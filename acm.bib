abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Parkinson's Disease impairs the motor, cognitive and emotional functioning of people. Clinicians do not get an accurate image of the disease because patients visit them every six months and their symptoms can change within hours. Technology has been used to tackle this problem, but most approaches disrupt people's routines or are uncomfortable to use. We aim to monitor Parkinson's in an unobtrusive, longitudinal and naturalistic way based on digital biomarkers inferred from smartphone-collected heterogeneous data. We use Parkinson's clinical scales and self-reporting of symptoms as ground truth to evaluate our methodology. Here, we present three insights we gained after tracking four people 24/7 for four months: a) the monitoring smartphone needs to be people's primary device, b) participants prefer a paper diary for symptom self-reporting, and c) social and phone interaction will be explored as digital biomarkers. We expect this approach to improve patient's quality of life and the efficiency of health services.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016. Interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) is a complex task involving visual inspection. This paper aims to improve understanding of how practitioners perceive ECGs, and determine whether visual behaviour can indicate differences in interpretation accuracy. A group of healthcare practitioners (n = 31) who interpret ECGs as part of their clinical role were shown 11 commonly encountered ECGs on a computer screen. The participants' eye movement data were recorded as they viewed the ECGs and attempted interpretation. The Jensen-Shannon distance was computed for the distance between two Markov chains, constructed from the transition matrices (visual shifts from and to ECG leads) of the correct and incorrect interpretation groups for each ECG. A permutation test was then used to compare this distance against 10,000 randomly shuffled groups made up of the same participants. The results demonstrated a statistically significant ($\alpha$0.05) result in 5 of the 11 stimuli demonstrating that the gaze shift between the ECG leads is different between the groups making correct and incorrect interpretations and therefore a factor in interpretation accuracy. The results shed further light on the relationship between visual behaviour and ECG interpretation accuracy, providing information that can be used to improve both human and automated interpretation approaches.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Authors. Video data of people interacting with devices contains rich information about human behaviour that can be used to design or improve user experience. As a first step, it must be interpreted - or coded - into a form that can be analyzed systematically. The coding process is currently performed manually, and it can be slow and difficult, and biased by subjectivity. This is particularly problematic when trying to obtain data that should be objective, such as the movements of a user in relation to a device. We describe Automated Behavioural Coding (ABC), an open source object tracking technique designed to log user and device movements, and then output positional data that can be used to model interaction. We validate the technique in a study of dual screen TV viewing, and show that the ABC tool is able to correctly classify the direction of gaze to the TV or tablet up to 95{\%} of the time, in a fraction of the time it takes to capture this data manually.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data discovery, particularly the discovery of key variables and their inter-relationships, is key to secondary data analysis, and in-turn, the evolving field of data science. Interface designers have presumed that their users are domain experts, and so they have provided complex interfaces to support these "experts." Such interfaces hark back to a time when searches needed to be accurate first time as there was a high computational cost associated with each search. Our work is part of a governmental research initiative between the medical and social research funding bodies to improve the use of social data in medical research. OBJECTIVE: The cross-disciplinary nature of data science can make no assumptions regarding the domain expertise of a particular scientist, whose interests may intersect multiple domains. Here we consider the common requirement for scientists to seek archived data for secondary analysis. This has more in common with search needs of the "Google generation" than with their single-domain, single-tool forebears. Our study compares a Google-like interface with traditional ways of searching for noncomplex health data in a data archive. METHODS: Two user interfaces are evaluated for the same set of tasks in extracting data from surveys stored in the UK Data Archive (UKDA). One interface, Web search, is "Google-like," enabling users to browse, search for, and view metadata about study variables, whereas the other, traditional search, has standard multioption user interface. RESULTS: Using a comprehensive set of tasks with 20 volunteers, we found that the Web search interface met data discovery needs and expectations better than the traditional search. A task Ã— interface repeated measures analysis showed a main effect indicating that answers found through the Web search interface were more likely to be correct (F1,19=37.3, P {\textless} .001), with a main effect of task (F3,57=6.3, P {\textless} .001). Further, participants completed the task significantly faster using the Web search interface (F1,19=18.0, P {\textless} .001). There was also a main effect of task (F2,38=4.1, P=.025, Greenhouse-Geisser correction applied). Overall, participants were asked to rate learnability, ease of use, and satisfaction. Paired mean comparisons showed that the Web search interface received significantly higher ratings than the traditional search interface for learnability (P=.002, 95{\%} CI [0.6-2.4]), ease of use (P {\textless} .001, 95{\%} CI [1.2-3.2]), and satisfaction (P {\textless} .001, 95{\%} CI [1.8-3.5]). The results show superior cross-domain usability of Web search, which is consistent with its general familiarity and with enabling queries to be refined as the search proceeds, which treats serendipity as part of the refinement. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide clear evidence that data science should adopt single-field natural language search interfaces for variable search supporting in particular: query reformulation; data browsing; faceted search; surrogates; relevance feedback; summarization, analytics, and visual presentation.},

Broadcasters see this as an opportunity to enhance a TV programme through the provision of additional information to the 'second screen', but determining how to optimise this experience is one of the grand challenges currently facing content providers. Addressing this issue requires a detailed understanding of interaction with both the TV and the secondary device, but this new form of HCI, as much about passive consumption as active interaction, is not well represented by typical task-based paradigms. This paper describes experiments that use eye tracking to understand one of the key components of this new area of study - determining which device is currently receiving the user's attention - and discusses the considerable challenge of accurately monitoring attention while maintaining ecological validity.},

abstract = {Having lung cancer is associated with accessibility issues because people afflicted with lung cancer tend to be older and less familiar with technology, and have low education levels and low health literacy. Fear, embarrassment and stigmatization also play a role. This makes it difficult for people to access the information they need to understand and manage their illness, particularly in the time before the diagnosis. We can mitigate these disadvantages and bridge the accessibility gap by ensuring people at risk for lung cancer are informed about symptoms and when to seek medical advice. The Web is uniquely placed to fulfill this role. We therefore developed an online lung cancer symptom appraisal tool tailored towards people with low education levels and health literacy and based on psychological theory to target barriers like fear and embarrassment. At present we are conducting a feasibility study to assess whether it is possible to reach the high risk population and encourage early help-seeking. So far, 97 users have participated, 97.9{\%} of which report symptoms and risk factors that indicate they should seek medical help. 34{\%} report education levels below school leaving qualification. Our tool led to a significantly higher intention to seek medical help than the same information without theory-based components (p = 0.01). Our initial analyses suggest this is a suitable approach to widening health education to excluded groups. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {Copyright 2015 ACM. Large websites are difficult to evaluate for Web Accessibility compliance due to the shear number of pages, the inaccuracy of current Web evaluation engines, and the W3C stated need to include human evaluators within the testing regime. This makes evaluating large websites all-but technically unfeasible. Therefore, sampling of the pages becomes a critical first step in the evaluation process. Current methods rely on drawing random samples, best guess samples, or convenience samples. In all cases the evaluation results cannot be trusted because the underlying structure and nature of the site are not known; they are missing 'website demographics'. By understanding the quantifiable statistics of a given population of pages we are better able to decide on the coverage we need for a full review, as well as the sample we need to draw in order to enact an evaluation. Our solution is to crawl a website comparing, and then clustering, the pages discovered based on Document Object Model block level similarity. This technique can be useful in reducing very large sites to a more manageable size, and allowing an 80{\%} coverage by evaluating between â‰ˆ 0.1-4{\%} of pages; additionally, by refining our clustering algorithm, we discuss how this could be reduced further.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web is a predominantly visual media for presenting and disseminating information. As such, visually impaired users, who access content through audio interaction, are hindered as the Web is not designed with their needs in mind. To compensate for this, visually impaired users develop behavioral strategies to cope when access to the content becomes challenging. While tools exist to aid visually impaired users in accessing the Web, they tend to focus on adapting content to meet the needs of the device rather than the user. Therefore, to further improve Web access an understanding of the behavioral strategies users employ is required. To achieve this, studies of eleven visually impaired Web users were conducted. The data from these sessions were analyzed to develop a framework for identifying strategies that users may employ when they face difficulties accessing the content. Using data for twenty visually impaired users obtained from an independent study, the framework was validated and shown to be flexible and accurate enough to be applicable to multiple data sources. An analysis of the coping strategies identified from the framework revealed six abstract patterns of coping. These patterns were used as the basis for developing behaviordriven transcoding that transformed static Web documents into interactive content by allowing users to navigate between key elements of the page through a consistent set of key presses. Results obtained from a user evaluation of the transcoding support the use of behavior-driven transcoding as a mechanism for improving access to Web content when compared to existing transcoding techniques. This result allows the coping strategies framework to be used as a foundation for further understanding of the strategies visually impaired users employ on Web sites and the transformations required to allow the Web to be accessible to those users. 2011 ACM.},

Hypertext design and usability guidelines have traditionally concentrated upon navigation to facilitate this mobility; consequently other aspects of travel are neglected.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004. Travelling upon the Web is difficult for visually impaired users since the Web pages are designed for visual interaction [6]. Visually impaired users usually use screen readers to access the Web in audio. However, unlike sighted users, screen readers cannot see the implicit structural and navigational knowledge encoded within the visual presentation of Web pages. Therefore, in a visually impaired user's environment, objects that support travel are missing or inaccessible. Our approach to remedy this is to annotate pages with an ontology, the Travel Ontology, that aims to encapsulate rich structural and navigational knowledge about these objects. We use Semantic Web technologies to make such knowledge explicit and computationally accessible. Our semi-automated tool, Dante identifies travel objects on Web pages, annotates them appropriately with the Travel Ontology and uses this to transform the pages to enhance the travel support. Thus Dante uses the Travel Ontology to enhance the travel experience of visually impaired users. This paper introduces the Travel Ontology, the annotation pipeline used in the annotation part of Dante and some transformation scenarios to illustrate how the annotations are used to guide the transformation of Web pages.},

We present an experiment comparing performance of 20 novice evaluators of accessibility carrying out Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 conformance reviews working individually to performance obtained when they work in teams of two. They were asked to first carry out an individual assessment of a web page. Later on, they were matched randomly to constitute a group of two and they were asked to revise their initial assessment and to produce a group assessment of the same page. Results indicate that significant differences were found for sensitivity (inversely related to false negatives: +8{\%}) and agreement (when measured in terms of the majority view: +10{\%}). Members of groups exhibited strong agreement on the evaluation results among them and with the group outcome. Other measures of validity and reliability are not significantly affected by group work. Practical implications of these findings are that, for example, when it is important to reduce the false-negative rate, then employing a group of two people is more useful than having individuals carrying out the assessment. Openings for future research include further explorations of whether similar results hold for groups larger than two or what is the effect of mixing people with different accessibility background. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS When novice accessibility evaluators work in groups, their ability to identify all the true problems increases (by 8{\%}). Likewise, reliability of group evaluations increases (by 10{\%}). Individual or group evaluations can be considered as equivalent methods with respect to false positives (if differences up to 8{\%} in correctness are tolerated). Individual or group evaluations can be considered as equivalent methods with respect to overall effectiveness (if differences up to 11{\%} in F-measure are tolerated).},

abstract = {World Wide Web accessibility and best practice audits and evaluations are becoming increasingly complicated, time consuming, and costly because of the increasing number of conformance criteria which need to be tested. In the case of web access by disabled users and mobile users, a number of commonalities have been identified in usage, which have been termed situationally-induced impairments; in effect the barriers experienced by mobile web users have been likened to those of visually disabled and motor impaired users. In this case, we became interested in understanding if it was possible to evaluate the problems of mobile web users in terms of the aggregation of barriers-to-access experienced by disabled users; and in this way attempt to reduce the need for the evaluation of the additional conformance criteria associated with mobile web best practice guidelines. We used the Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method as our analytical framework. Capable of being used to evaluate accessibility in both the disabled and mobile contexts, the BW method would also enable testing and aggregation of barriers across our target user groups. We tested 61 barriers across four user groups each over four pages with 19 experts and 57 non-experts focusing on the validity and reliability of our results. We found that 58{\%} of the barrier types that were correctly found were identified as common between mobile and disabled users. Further, if our aggregated barriers alone were used to test for mobile conformance only four barrier types would be missed. Our results also showed that mobile users and low vision users have the most common barrier types, while low vision and motor impaired users experiencing similar rates of severity in the barriers they experienced. We conclude that the aggregated evaluation results for blind, low vision and motor impaired users can be used to approximate the evaluation results for mobile web users. {\textcopyright} 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

This paper describes empirical work which makes the link between the behaviour of motor impaired desktop users and non-impaired users of small-devices. This is important because it may, therefore, be possible to leverage existing solutions for motor-impaired users into the small-device domain. We find that there is significant overlap in the extent of the problems encountered, but not the magnitude. Eight of the 11 existing errors made by motor-impaired users were also present in our small-device study in which two additional error types, key ambiguity and landing errors, were also observed. In addition, small-device rates for common error types were higher than those of desktop users with no impairment, but lower than those of desktop users with motor impairments. We suggest that this difference is because all users were seated to maintain constancy between studies and assert that this magnitude difference will equalise once the small-device is used in a mobile context. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM. Eye tracking studies have widely been used in improving the design and usability of web pages and in the research of understanding how users navigate them. However, there is limited research in clustering users' eye movement sequences (i.e., scanpaths) on web pages to identify a general direction they follow. Existing research tends to be reductionist, which means that the resulting path is so short that it is not useful. Moreover, there is little work on correlating users' scanpaths with visual elements of web pages and the underlying source code, which means the result cannot be used for further processing. In order to address these limitations, we introduce a new concept in clustering scanpaths called Scanpath Trend Analysis (STA) that not only considers the visual elements visited by all users, but also considers the visual elements visited by the majority in any order. We present an algorithm which automatically does this trend analysis to identify a trending scanpath for multiple web users in terms of visual elements of a web page. In contrast to existing research, the STA algorithm first analyzes the most visited visual elements in given scanpaths, clusters the scanpaths by arranging these visual elements based on their overall positions in the individual scanpaths, and then constructs a trending scanpath in terms of these visual elements. This algorithm was experimentally evaluated by an eye tracking study on six web pages for two different kinds of tasks (12 cases in total). Our experimental results show that the STA algorithm generates a trending scanpath that addresses the reductionist problem of existing work by preventing the loss of commonly visited visual elements for all cases. Based on the statistical tests, the STA algorithm also generates a trending scanpath that is significantly more similar to the inputted scanpaths compared to other existing work in 10 out of 12 cases. In the remaining cases, the STA algorithm still performs significantly better than some other existing work. This algorithm contributes to behavior analysis research on the web that can be used for different purposes: for example, re-engineering web pages guided by the trending scanpath to improve users' experience or guiding designers to improve their design.},

Accessibility guidelines are often criticised by their partial coverage and questionable validity. However, we should be very careful about making categorical statements in this regard as there are a number of variables that may introduce biases in user tests. We identify sources of bias related to user expertise, the experimental setting, employed language and reporting that, if not adequately controlled, may influence on the validity and reliability of the evaluation results.

abstract = {The 'Towel' project seeks to find solutions to problems encountered by visually impaired users when travelling in the World-Wide-Web (Web) by leveraging solutions found in real-world mobility. Visually impaired users find mobility on the Web particularly difficult because of the reliance of hypermedia on visual layout. Hypertext design and usability guidelines have traditionally concentrated upon navigation to facilitate this mobility; consequently other aspects of travel are neglected. This paper seeks to address these issues by extending current guidelines and design methods to include the real-world mobility concepts of orientation, memory, environment, preview and the purpose of the task at hand.

abstract = {Web accessibility means that disabled people can effectively perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web. Web accessibility evaluation methods are needed to validate the accessibility of web pages. However, the role of subjectivity and of expertise in such methods is unknown and has not previously been studied. This article investigates the effect of expertise in web accessibility evaluation methods by conducting a Barrier Walkthrough (BW) study with 19 expert and 57 nonexpert judges. The BW method is an evaluation method that can be used to manually assess the accessibility of web pages for different user groups such as motor impaired, low vision, blind, and mobile users. Our results show that expertise matters, and even though the effect of expertise varies depending on the metric used to measure quality, the level of expertise is an important factor in the quality of accessibility evaluation of web pages. In brief, when pages are evaluated with nonexperts, we observe a drop in validity and reliability. We also observe a negative monotonic relationship between number of judges and reproducibility: more evaluators mean more diverse outputs. After five experts, reproducibility stabilizes, but this is not the case with nonexperts. The ability to detect all the problems increases with the number of judges: With 3 experts all problems can be found, but for such a level 14 nonexperts are needed. Even though our data show that experts rated pages differently, the difference is quite small. Finally, compared to nonexperts, experts spent much less time and the variability among them is smaller, they were significantly more confident, and they rated themselves as being more productive. The article discusses practical implications regarding how BW results should be interpreted, how to recruit evaluators, and what happens when more than one evaluator is hired.

SADIe uses semantic annotations of a Website's Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to drive a transformation process that can improve access to content for visually impaired users. The original process of annotating the CSS involved the use of an upper ontology, extended by a site specific lower ontology. While this approach provided rich annotation of the CSS terms, experience suggests that components within the model were inappropriate for the interactive system we were developing. This experience has led to a more pragmatic approach that still provides the necessary semantics required to drive the SADIe transcoding tool, but in a more lightweight manner.

The number of users required for usability studies has been a controversial issue over 30 years. Some researchers suggest a certain number of users to be included in these studies. However, they do not focus on eye tracking studies for analysing eye movement sequences of users (i.e., scanpaths) on web pages. We investigate the effects of the number of users on scanpath analysis with our algorithm that was designed for identifying the most commonly followed path by multiple users. Our experimental results suggest that it is possible to approximate the same results with a smaller number of users. The results also suggest that more users are required when they serendipitously browse on web pages in comparison with when they search for specific information or items. We observed that we could achieve 75{\%} similarity to the results of 65 users with 27 users for searching tasks and 34 users for browsing tasks. This study guides researchers to determine the ideal number of users for analysing scanpaths on web pages based on their budget and time.},

Detailed Web interaction data gathered in the wild (from URLs visited, to keystrokes and mouse movements) has the potential to provide an indepth, ecologically valid view of interaction, and enable an understanding of how behaviour evolves over time. Interpreting such data is extremely challenging, however. We present a longitudinal data-driven analysis of fine-grained interaction data captured from 14,000 recurrent users over 12 months. At the core of our approach is the aggregation of low-level interaction data into micro behaviours. By analysing changes in these behaviours as a function of users' accumulated interaction time, we were able to demonstrate how users' interaction evolves as they become more familiar with a Web page. The results demonstrate that monitoring micro behaviours offers a simple and easily extensible post hoc means of understanding how Web-based behaviour evolves over time.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. Web pages are typically decorated with different kinds of visual elements that help sighted people complete their tasks. Unfortunately, this is not the case for people accessing web pages in constraint environments such as visually disabled or small screen device users. In our previous work, we show that tracking the eye movements of sighted users provide good understanding of how people use these visual elements. We also show that people's experience in constraint environments can be improved by reengineering web pages by using these visual elements. However, in order to reengineer web pages based on eyetracking, we first need to aggregate, analyse and understand how a group of people's eyetracking data can be combined to create a common scanpath (namely, eye movement sequence) in terms of visual elements. This paper presents an algorithm that aims to achieve this. This algorithm was developed iteratively and experimentally evaluated with an eyetracking study. This study shows that the proposed algorithm is able to identify patterns in eyetracking scanpaths and it is fairly scalable. This study also shows that this algorithm can be improved by considering different techniques for pre-processing the data, by addressing the drawbacks of using the hierarchical structure and by taking into account the underlying cognitive processes.},

abstract = {On simple Web pages, the text to speech translation provided by a screen reader works relatively well. This is not the case for more sophisticated 'Web 2.0' pages, in which many interactive visual features, such as tickers, tabs, auto-suggest lists, calendars and slideshows currently remain inaccessible. Determining how to present these in audio is challenging in general, but may be particularly so for certain groups, such as people with congenital or early-onset blindness, as they are not necessarily familiar with the visual interaction metaphors that are involved. This article describes an evaluation of an audio Web browser designed using a novel approach, whereby visual content is translated to audio using algorithms derived from observing how sighted users interact with it. Both quantitative and qualitative measures showed that all participants, irrespective of the onset of their visual impairment, preferred the visual interaction-based audio mappings. Participants liked the fact that the mappings made the dynamic content truly accessible, rather than merely available to those who could find it, as is presently the case. The results indicate that this 'visual-centred' mapping approach may prove to be a suitable technique for translating complex visual content to audio, even for users with early-onset visual disabilities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {Web site-evaluation methodologies and validation engines take the view that all accessibility guidelines must be met to gain compliance. Problems exist in this regard, as contradictions within the rule set may arise, and the type of impairment or its severity is not isolated. The Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method goes someway to addressing these issues, by enabling barrier types derived from guidelines to be applied to different user categories such as motor or visual impairment, etc. However, the problem remains of combinatorial explosion of possibilities when one has to consider users with multiple disabilities. In this paper, a simple set theory operation is used to create a validation scheme for older users by aggregating barrier types specific to motor impaired and low-vision users, thereby creating a new "older users" category from the results of this set union. To evaluate the feasibility and validity of this aggregation approach, two BW experiments were conducted. The first experiment evaluated the aggregated results by focusing on quality attributes and showed that aggregation generates data whose quality is comparable to the original one. However, this first experiment could not test for validity, as the older users category was not included. To remedy this deficiency, another BW experiment was conducted with expert judges who evaluated a web page in the context of older users. In this second experiment, it was found that there is no significant difference between the aggregated and the manually evaluated (by experts) barrier scores, and that the same barriers are identified using experts and aggregation, even though there are differences in how severity scores are distributed. From these results, it is concluded that the aggregation of barriers is a viable alternative to expert evaluation, when the target of that aggregation could not be evaluated manually or it would not be feasible to do so. It is also argued that aggregation is a technique that can be used in combination with other evaluation methods, like user testing or subjective assessments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

These visual elements are mainly the segments of a page generated by automated segmentation approaches. In our previous work, we also showed that the STA algorithm performs better than other existing algorithms in terms of providing the most representative scanpath of users. However, we did not know whether the validity of the algorithm is limited to a particular segmentation approach. In this paper, we investigate the effect of two different segmentation approaches on the STA algorithm. The results suggest that the validity of the algorithm is not affected by the segmentation approach used. Specifically, the resulting scanpath of the STA algorithm is the most representative scanpath of users in comparison with the resulting scanpaths of other existing algorithms regardless of the segmentation approach used.},

abstract = {Background: The Web has become an important information source for appraising symptoms. We need to understand the role it currently plays in help seeking and symptom evaluation to leverage its potential to support health care delivery. Objective: The aim was to systematically review the literature currently available on Web use for symptom appraisal. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and Web of Science for any empirical studies that addressed the use of the Web by lay people to evaluate symptoms for physical conditions. Articles were excluded if they did not meet minimum quality criteria. Study findings were synthesized using a thematic approach. Results: A total of 32 studies were included. Study designs included cross-sectional surveys, qualitative studies, experimental studies, and studies involving website/search engine usage data. Approximately 35{\%} of adults engage in Web use for symptom appraisal, but this proportion varies between 23{\%} and 75{\%} depending on sociodemographic and disease-related factors. Most searches were symptom-based rather than condition-based. Users viewed only the top search results and interacted more with results that mentioned serious conditions. Web use for symptom appraisal appears to impact on the decision to present to health services, communication with health professionals, and anxiety. Conclusions: Web use for symptom appraisal has the potential to influence the timing of help seeking for symptoms and the communication between patients and health care professionals during consultations. However, studies lack suitable comparison groups as well as follow-up of participants over time to determine whether Web use results in health care utilization and diagnosis. Future research should involve longitudinal follow-up so that we can weigh the benefits of Web use for symptom appraisal (eg, reductions in delays to diagnosis) against the disadvantages (eg, unnecessary anxiety and health care use) and relate these to health care costs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Early prototyping of user interfaces is an established good practice in interactive system development. However, prototypes cover only some usage scenarios, and questions dealing with number of required steps, possible interaction paths or impact of possible user errors can be answered only for the specific scenarios and only after tedious manual inspection. We present a tool (MIGTool) that transforms models of the behavior of a user interface into a graph, upon which usage scenarios can be easily specified, and used by MIGTool to compute possible interaction paths. Metrics based on possible paths, with or without user navigation errors, can then be computed. For example, when analyzing four mail applications, we show that Gmail has 3 times more shortest routes, has twice more routes that include a single user error, has routes with 13{\%}fewer steps, but has also optimal routes with the smallest probability to be chosen. Without MIGTool, this kind of analysis could only be done after building some prototype of the system, and then only for specific scenarios by manually tracing user actions and relative changes to the screens. With MIGTool the exploration of suitability of a design with respect to different scenarios, or comparison of different design alternatives against a single scenario, can be done with just a partial specification of the user interface behavior. This is made possible by the ability to associate scenarios steps to required user actions as defined in the model, by an efficient strategy to identify complete execution traces that users can follow, and by computing a range of diverse metrics on these results.},

abstract = {Web accessibility conjures the vision of designers, technologists, and researchers valiantly making the World-Wide-Web (Web) open to disabled users. While this maybe true in part, the reality is a little different. Indeed, Web accessibility is actually about correcting our past mistakes by making the current Web fulfill the original Web vision of access for all. It just so happens that in the process of trying to re-engineer these corrections, that have for the most part ignored, we may solve a number of 'larger- scale' usability issues faced by every Web user. Indeed, by understanding disabled-user's interaction we enhance our understanding of all users operating in constrained modalities where the user is disabled by both environment and technology. It is for this reason that Web accessibility is a natural preface to wider Web usability and universal accessibility, it is also why 'main-stream' technologist take it so seriously and understand its cross-over benefits. {\textcopyright} 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. A strength of IFML derives from its ability to support generation of a user interface by coupling data and control models. However, separation of concerns between different models (and in particular between models of control and of data) could be beneficial to better understand generation principles and expressivity limits, to support computation of design quality metrics, and to formulate intra-model transformation rules. In the paper we show that such a separation is indeed possible using UML class and state diagrams. We present the generation rules that a compiler follows for producing user interfaces. Based on the adopted representation, we argue that certain expressive limits are due to the underlying foundation common of our approach and of IFML.},

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that Web document summaries provide the sighted reader with a basis for making decisions regarding the route to take within non-linear text; and additional research shows that sighted people use 'Gist' summaries as decision points to bolster their browsing behaviour. Other studies have found that visually impaired users are hindered in their cognition of the content of Web-pages because users must wait for an entire Web-page to be read before deciding on it's usefulness to their current task. In these cases, we draw similarities between sighted and visually impaired users, in that sighted users cannot see the target of a Web Anchor and are therefore 'handicapped' 1  by the technology. Previously, we have investigate four simple summarisation algorithms against each other and a manually created summary; producing empirical evidence as a formative evaluation. This evaluation concludes that users prefer simple automatically generated 'gist' summaries thereby reducing cognitive overload and increasing awareness of the focus of the Web-page under investigation. In this paper we focus on the development of 'FireFox' based tool which creates a summary of a Web page 'on-the-fly'. The algorithm used to create this summary is based on the results of our formative evaluation which automatically and dynamically annotates Web pages with the generated 'gist' summary. In this way visually impaired users are supported in their decisions as the relevancy of the page at hand. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery. Web-based interactive systems can be verified and validated with eye tracking which provides valuable insights for understanding user interactions. However, individual eye movements (scanpaths) tend to be complicated and different from each other. Existing algorithms focus on clustering multiple scanpaths into a single representative path, but do not tolerate differences. This may result in excluding some popular elements from the resulting path and the representativeness of the path can decrease. Scanpath Trend Analysis (STA) is one of these algorithms which is being increasingly used. It can be used for identifying trending areas of interest (AoIs) on a web page among multiple users and discovering their trending path in terms of these AoIs. Compared to the outputs of other algorithms, the output of the STA algorithm is the most representative. Since this algorithm considers all given scanpaths while discovering their trending path, it can be negatively affected when the variance is high between the scanpaths. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter to the STA algorithm, called tolerance level. This parameter makes the algorithm more tolerant by allowing the identification of trending AoIs based on a subset of given scanpaths instead of all of them. Our study shows that the STA algorithm can achieve more representative path with a tolerance. Thus, the validity and verification of interactive systems can be investigated with more representative path.},

However, the increasing requirements of the mobile platform is placing higher demands on this capacity. In this case, there are three options: decrease our expectations of the mobile platform, increase the capacity and therefore size and weight of our batteries, or create energy saving solutions to extend battery-life with minimal effect on platform performance. Here we present a system called Twes+ which is inline with the last option and aims to transcode web pages for increasing battery-life when surfing-the-web without changing the look and feel. Our evaluation results show that there is a statistically significant energy saving when using our Twes+ transcoder. Our redirect service brings a 4.6{\%} cumulative processor energy reduction, while image transcoding service, brings a 7{\%} cumulative processor energy reduction. These savings equate to between a 40 to 60min saving depending on the mobile device.},

abstract = {Background: Delays to diagnosis in lung cancer can lead to reduced chance of survival, and patients often wait for several months before presenting symptoms. The time between first symptom recognition until diagnosis has been theorized into three intervals: symptom appraisal, help-seeking, and diagnostic interval (here: "pathway to diagnosis"). Interventions are needed to reduce delays to diagnosis in lung cancer. The Web has become an important lay health information source and could potentially play a role in this pathway to diagnosis. Objective: Our overall aim was to gain a preliminary insight into whether Web-based information plays a role in the pathway to diagnosis in lung cancer in order to assess whether it may be possible to leverage this information source to reduce delays to diagnosis. Methods: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer in the 6 months before study entry completed a survey about whether (and how, if yes) they had used the Web to appraise their condition prior to diagnosis. Based on survey responses, we purposively sampled patients and their next-of-kin for semistructured interviews (24 interviews; 33 participants). Interview data were analyzed qualitatively using Framework Analysis in the context of the pathway to diagnosis model. Results: A total of 113 patients completed the survey (age: mean 67.0, SD 8.8 years). In all, 20.4{\%} (23/113) reported they or next-of-kin had researched their condition online before the diagnosis. The majority of searches (20/23, 87.0{\%}) were conducted by or with the help of next-of-kin. Interview results suggest that patients and next-of-kin perceived an impact of the information found online on all three intervals in the time to diagnosis. In the appraisal interval, participants used online information to evaluate symptoms and possible causes. In the help-seeking interval, the Web was used to inform the decision of whether to present to health services. In the diagnostic interval, it was used to evaluate health care professionals' advice, to support requests for further investigation of symptoms, and to understand medical jargon. Within this interval, we identified two distinct subintervals (before/after relevant diagnostic tests were initiated), in which the Web reportedly played different roles. Conclusions: Because only 20.4{\%} of the sample reported prediagnosis Web searches, it seems the role of the Web before diagnosis of lung cancer is at present still limited, but this proportion is likely to increase in the future, when barriers such as unfamiliarity with technology and unwillingness to be informed about one's own health are likely to decrease. Participants' perceptions suggest that the Web can have an impact on all three intervals in the pathway to diagnosis. Thus, the Web may hold the potential to reduce delays in the diagnostic process, and this should be explored in future research and interventions. Our results also suggest a division of the diagnostic interval into two subintervals may be useful.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors We propose a set of algorithms to detect navigation problems in real-time. To do so, we operationalise some navigation strategies suggested by the literature and investigate the extent to which the exhibition of these strategies is an indicator of navigation problems. Our Firefox extension senses behaviour indicative of a user experiencing interaction problems. Once these problems are detected we can suggest changes to these sites, and eventually adapt the site in real time to better accommodate the user. A remote longitudinal study monitored real website user behaviour, analysing every application event on the client side both individually and in combination. The study was conducted with 34 participants over 400 days totalling 567Â h of normal usage and with no task restriction. Our sensing algorithms detected 374 issues with a 85{\%} precision for purposeful Web use, suggesting that, indeed, when users search for specific information the exhibition of these strategies indicates the presence of problems. This contribution is novel in that, as opposed to a post-hoc analysis of user interaction, real-time detection of navigation problems at the user end opens up new research avenues in the realm of adaptive interfaces and usability analysis.},

abstract = {n 1891 master cutler Karl Elsener invented his first multi function tool, the `Offiziermesser', a soldier's knife designed to universally meet the needs of the soldier and woodsman. This officer's knife was renamed by American GIs1 in 1945 to the more commonly known `Swiss Army Knife'. Adopted by outdoor enthusiasts worldwide, its popularity has increased, as have the number of varieties and styles. The tool, which is designed-for-all your outdoor needs, and built so that one design is universally acceptable to all, now has over 100 combinations. One of the key ideas of making the World Wide Web (web) accessible to users with disabilities is this same idea of design-for-all, which so inspired Karl Elsener: a concept which proposes that every web page should be designed so that as many people as possible can access it, regardless of any sensory or cognitive impairments. However, design-for-all can mean many things to many people. Some discuss design in terms of the society at large, by making reference to socio economics, ethics, and issues of general discrimination. Others see design-for-all as a technological issue and a problem to be solved. Still others link design-for-all to a way of thought that should encompass everyone. In the context of computing and software development, many suggest that technology must focus on designing products so that they are usable by the widest range of people. Yet, in reality, every person is a unique individual and so this view cannot possibly be sustainable or achievable.},

World Wide Web accessibility and best practice audits and evaluations are becoming increasingly complicated, time consuming, and costly because of the increasing number of conformance criteria which need to be tested. In the case of web access by disabled users and mobile users, a number of commonalities have been identified in usage, which have been termed situationally-induced impairments; in effect the barriers experienced by mobile web users have been likened to those of visually disabled and motor impaired users. In this case, we became interested in understanding if it was possible to evaluate the problems of mobile web users in terms of the aggregation of barriers-to-access experienced by disabled users; and in this way attempt to reduce the need for the evaluation of the additional conformance criteria associated with mobile web best practice guidelines. We used the Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method as our analytical framework. Capable of being used to evaluate accessibility in both the disabled and mobile contexts, the BW method would also enable testing and aggregation of barriers across our target user groups.
We tested 61 barriers across four user groups each over four pages with 19 experts and 57 non-experts focusing on the validity and reliability of our results. We found that 58{\%} of the barrier types that were correctly found were identified as common between mobile and disabled users. Further, if our aggregated barriers alone were used to test for mobile conformance only four barrier types would be missed. Our results also showed that mobile users and low vision users have the most common barrier types, while low vision and motor impaired users experiencing similar rates of severity in the barriers they experienced. We conclude that the aggregated evaluation results for blind, low vision and motor impaired users can be used to approximate the evaluation results for mobile web users.},

To those who are accessing pages through non-visual means, such as screen readers, the challenges offered by these tasks are not easily overcome, even when pages are unchanging documents. The advent of `Web 2.0' and Web applications, however, means that documents often are not static, but update, either automatically or due to user interaction. This development poses a difficult question for screen reader designers: how should users be notified of page changes? In this article we introduce rules for presenting such updates, derived from studies of how sighted users interact with them. An implementation of the rules has been evaluated, showing that users who were blind or visually impaired found updates easier to deal with than the relatively quiet way in which current screen readers often present them.},

abstract = {Access is what the web is 'about', it is the motivation behind its creation, and it is the rationale behind HTML. The desire to provide all users at CERN with the ability to access all documents was Tim Berners-Lee's primary goal, and this goal must also be carried through to equal access for all users. But this equality of access -- accessibility -- is difficult to quantify, define, or agree upon. In a constantly evolving field, understanding each other can be tricky; indeed, there are many different definitions in the literature, all with a different perspective. This makes it difficult for our community to interact, reach agreement, or share understanding. What is more, it makes it very difficult for those outside the web accessibility community to understand, plan, budget, enact policy, or conform to accessibility requirements and legislation when the community itself has so many, in some cases, conflicting definitions. We asked over 300 people, with an interest in accessibility, to discuss their views and definitions in an attempt to harmonise our understanding and support the expectations of users outside the community. We find that misunderstanding accessibility definitions, language, and terms might cause tension between different groups. That social, and not economic, aspects drive our perspectives of accessibility, and that definitions used by standards and regulatory bodies are most accepted - not those of individual experts. Forcing accessibility adoption does not encourage the acceptance of an accessibility ethos, but providing empirical evidence that accessibility benefits all, does. Finally, realistic and concise language was preferred when attempting to communicate, or define accessibility.},

abstract = {This is a technological review paper focussed on identifying both the research challenges and opportunities for further investigation arising from emerging technologies, and it does not aim to propose any recommendation or standard. It is focussed on blind and partially sighted World Wide Web (Web) users along with others who use assistive technologies. The Web is a fast moving interdisciplinary domain in which new technologies, techniques and research is in perpetual development. It is often difficult to maintain a holistic view of new developments within the multiple domains which together make up the Web. This suggests that knowledge of the current developments and predictions of future developments are additionally important for the accessibility community. Web accessibility has previously been characterised by the correction of our past mistakes to make the current Web fulfil the original vision of access for all. New technologies were not designed with accessibility in mind and technologies that could be useful for addressing accessibility issues were not identified or adopted by the accessibility community. We wish to enable the research community to undertake preventative measures and proactively address challenges, while recognising opportunities, before they become unpreventable or require retrospective technological enhancement. This article then reviews emerging trends within the Web and Web Accessibility domains.},

abstract = {Web accessibility means that disabled people can effectively perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web. Web accessibility evaluation methods are needed to validate the accessibility of web pages. However, the role of subjectivity and of expertise in such methods is unknown and has not previously been studied. This article investigates the effect of expertise in web accessibility evaluation methods by conducting a Barrier Walkthrough (BW) study with 19 expert and 57 nonexpert judges. The BW method is an evaluation method that can be used to manually assess the accessibility of web pages for different user groups such as motor impaired, low vision, blind, and mobile users.

Our results show that expertise matters, and even though the effect of expertise varies depending on the metric used to measure quality, the level of expertise is an important factor in the quality of accessibility evaluation of web pages. In brief, when pages are evaluated with nonexperts, we observe a drop in validity and reliability. We also observe a negative monotonic relationship between number of judges and reproducibility: more evaluators mean more diverse outputs. After five experts, reproducibility stabilizes, but this is not the case with nonexperts. The ability to detect all the problems increases with the number of judges: With 3 experts all problems can be found, but for such a level 14 nonexperts are needed. Even though our data show that experts rated pages differently, the difference is quite small. Finally, compared to nonexperts, experts spent much less time and the variability among them is smaller, they were significantly more confident, and they rated themselves as being more productive. The article discusses practical implications regarding how BW results should be interpreted, how to recruit evaluators, and what happens when more than one evaluator is hired.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that guidelines employed in conformance testing do not catch all the accessibility barriers encountered by users on the Web. Since accessibility is strongly tied to the users' experience there is a subjective perception of accessibility barriers and their severity. What is more, not only intangible qualities characterise the way in which these barriers are perceived, but also navigation styles, age, onset, expertise and abilities play a key role. In order to overcome the limitations of conformance testing and catch the problems that emerge during the interaction we propose a user-interaction-driven method to automatically report accessibility problems. To do so, we initially isolate the problematic situations faced by users and the tactics employed in such situations. These tactics are considered behavioural markers of cognitive processes that indicate problematic situations; the presence of tactics denotes the presence of problems. Then, we design and deploy algorithms to automatically detect the exhibition of these tactics and consequently detect problematic situations. WebTactics, a tool that unobtrusively detects and reports the problematic situations undergone by visually disabled users illustrates the method we propose.},

abstract = {Presenting Web content through screen readers can be a challenging task, but this is the only means of access for many blind and visually impaired users. The difficulties are more acute when the information forms part of an interactive process, such as the increasingly common ``Web 2.0 applications''. If the process is to be completed correctly and efficiently it is vital that appropriate information is given to the user at an appropriate time. Designing a non-visual interface that achieves these aims is a non-trivial task, for which several approaches are possible. The one taken here is to use eye-tracking to understand how sighted users interact with the content, and to gain insight into how they benefit from the information, then apply this understanding to design a non-visual user interface. This paper describes how this technique was applied to develop audio interfaces for two common types of interaction---auto-suggest lists and pop-up calendars. Although the resulting interfaces were quite different, one largely mirroring the visual representation and the other not, evaluations showed that the approach was effective, with both audio implementations effective and popular with participants.},

Our previous work analysed the responses of web accessibility specialists in regard to a number of pre-defined definitions of accessibility. While uncovering much, this analysis did not allow us to quantify the communities understanding of the relationship accessibility has with other domains, and assess how the community scopes accessibility. In this case, we asked over 300 people, with an interest in accessibility, to answer 33 questions surrounding the relationship between accessibility, user experience (UX) and usability; inclusion, and exclusion; and evaluation, in an attempt to harmonise our understanding of web accessibility. We found that respondents think that accessibility and usability are highly related and also think that accessibility is applicable to everyone and not just people with disabilities. Respondents strongly agree that accessibility must be grounded on user-centred practices and that accessibility evaluation is more than just inspecting source code, however, they are divided as to whether training in ?Web Content Accessibility Guidelines? is necessary or not to assess accessibility. These perceptions are important for usability and UX professionals, developers of automated evaluation tools, and those practitioners running web site evaluations.},

We provide insights on the adaptation process of novice visually disabled users through a snapshot that depicts their first encounters with the Web during a period of 2 months. We discover that, as the sessions go on, last resort tactics are replaced by more sophisticated exploration tactics, which suggests that users not only become more skilled, but also more independent and autonomous. We observe that at later stages, tasks are more effectively accomplished at the expenses of reduced efficiency. We propose 2 explanations for this phenomenon: at later stages users may be more prone to misuse tactics from a larger repertoire or alternatively, they may feel more confident and less thoughtful. Design implications suggest that, initially, users should be provided with mechanisms to recover from failure, while interventions at later stages should not interfere with the learning process.},

Unfortunately the default behaviour of ATs when handling such pages is often sub-optimal, leaving users struggling to use the content. We present ACup: a flexible approach that injects JavaScript into the page to detect and classify any changes to the Document Object Model (DOM). These changes are then presented to the user using a WAI-ARIA live region that was injected when the page was loaded. The style of presentation varies according to the characteristics of each update (using rules previously bound to be effective) and can simply be changed, for example to test novel presentation approaches, or to apply a more fine-grained classification. This may be used to enable AT users to benefit more rapidly from advances in user-interface design.},

abstract = {The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 separate testing into both ``Machine'' and ``Human'' audits; and further classify ``Human Testability'' into ``Reliably Human Testable'' and ``Not Reliably Testable''; it is human testability that is the focus of this paper. We wanted to investigate the likelihood that ``at least 80{\%} of knowledgeable human evaluators would agree on the conclusion'' of an accessibility audit, and therefore understand the percentage of success criteria that could be described as reliably human testable, and those that could not. In this case, we recruited twenty-five experienced evaluators to audit four pages for WCAG 2.0 conformance. These pages were chosen to differ in layout, complexity, and accessibility support, thereby creating a small but variable sample.

We found that an 80{\%} agreement between experienced evaluators almost never occurred and that the average agreement was at the 70--75{\%} mark, while the error rate was around 29{\%}. Further, trained---but novice---evaluators performing the same audits exhibited the same agreement to that of our more experienced ones, but a reduction on validity of 6--13{\%} ; the validity that an untrained user would attain can only be a conjecture. Expertise appears to improve (by 19{\%}) the ability to avoid false positives. Finally, pooling the results of two independent experienced evaluators would be the best option, capturing at most 76{\%} of the true problems and producing only 24{\%} of false positives. Any other independent combination of audits would achieve worse results.

This means that an 80{\%} target for agreement, when audits are conducted without communication between evaluators, is not attainable, even with experienced evaluators, when working on pages similar to the ones used in this experiment; that the error rate even for experienced evaluators is relatively high and further, that untrained accessibility auditors be they developers or quality testers from other domains, would do much worse than this.},

In order to analyse how visually disabled users deal with problematic situations we carried out a secondary analysis of 2 independent datasets containing the interaction of 24 users. As a result, we determine the situations in which coping occurs including uncertainty, reduced mobility, confusion and overload, and identify 17 tactics employed to overcome these situations, being impulsive clicking, exploration tactics and re-doing some of the most noteworthy. These tactics are novel in that they are contextualised and complete: their presence denotes the presence of specific problems. Therefore, these tactics are behavioural markers of cognitive processes that indicate problematic situations.

abstract = {Laboratory studies are a well established practice that present disadvantages in terms of data collection. One of these disadvantages is that laboratories are controlled environments that do not account for unpredicted factors from the real world. Laboratory studies are also obtrusive and therefore possibly biased. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community has acknowledged these problems and has started exploring in-situ observation techniques. These observation techniques allow for bigger participant pools and their environments can conform to the real world. Such real-world observations are particularly important to the accessibility community who has coined the concept accessibility-in-use to differentiate real world from laboratory studies. Real-world observations provide low-level interaction data therefore making a bottom-up analysis possible. This way behaviours emerge from the obtained data instead of looking for predefined models. Some in-situ techniques employ Web logs in which the data is too coarse to infer meaningful user interaction. In some other cases an exhaustive manual modification is required to capture interaction data from a Web application. We describe a tool which is easily deployable in any Web application and captures longitudinal interaction data unobtrusively. It enables the observation of accessibility-in-use and guides the detection of emerging tasks.},

abstract = {Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) require that success criteria be tested by human inspection. Further, testability of WCAG 2.0 criteria is achieved if 80{\%} of knowledgeable inspectors agree that the criteria has been met or not. In this paper we investigate the very core WCAG 2.0, being their ability to determine web content accessibility conformance. We conducted an empirical study to ascertain the testability of WCAG 2.0 success criteria when experts and non-experts evaluated four relatively complex web pages; and the differences between the two. Further, we discuss the validity of the evaluations generated by these inspectors and look at the differences in validity due to expertise.

In summary, our study, comprising 22 experts and 27 non-experts, shows that approximately 50{\%} of success criteria fail to meet the 80{\%} agreement threshold; experts produce 20{\%} false positives and miss 32{\%} of the true problems. We also compared the performance of experts against that of non-experts and found that agreement for the non-experts dropped by 6{\%}, false positives reach 42{\%} and false negatives 49{\%}. This suggests that in many cases WCAG 2.0 conformance cannot be tested by human inspection to a level where it is believed that at least 80{\%} of knowledgeable human evaluators would agree on the conclusion. Why experts fail to meet the 80{\%} threshold and what can be done to help achieve this level are the subjects of further investigation.},

abstract = { The perception of the visual complexity of World Wide Web (Web) pages is a topic of significant interest. Previous work has examined the relationship between complexity and various aspects of presentation, including font styles, colours and images, but automatically quantifying this dimension of a web page at the level of the document remains a challenge. In this paper we demonstrate that areas of high complexity can be identified by detecting areas, or `chunks', of a web page high in block-level elements. We report a computational algorithm that captures this metric and places web pages in a sequence that shows an 86{\%} correlation with the sequences generated through user judgements of complexity. The work shows that structural aspects of a web page influence how complex a user perceives it to be, and presents a straightforward means of determining complexity through examining the DOM. },

annote = {Little is known about the navigation tactics employed by screen reader users when they face problematic situations on the Web. Understanding how these tactics are operationalised and knowing the situations that bring about such tactics paves the way towards modeling navigation behaviour. Modeling the navigation of users is of utmost importance as it allows not only to predict interactive behaviour, but also to assess the appropriateness of the content in a link, the information architecture of a site and the design of a web page. Current navigation models do not consider the extreme adaptations, namely coping tactics, that screen reader users undergo on the Web. Consequently, their prediction power is lessened and coping tactics are mistakenly considered outlying behaviours. We draw from existing navigation models for sighted users to suggest the incorporation of emerging behaviours in navigation models for screen reader users. To do so, we identify the navigation coping tactics screen reader users exhibit on the Web, including deliberately clicking on low scented links, escaping from useless or inaccessible content and backtracking to a shelter. Our findings suggest that, especially in problematic situations, navigation is not driven by information scent or utility, but by the need of increasing autonomy and the need of escaping from the current web patch.},

abstract = {World Wide Web (Web) documents, once delivered in a form that remained constant whilst viewed, are now often dynamic, with sections of a page able to change independently, either automatically or as a result of user interaction. In order to make these updates, and hence their host pages, accessible, it is necessary to detect when the update occurs and how it has changed the page, before determining how, when and what to present to the user. This can only be achieved with an understanding of both the technologies used to achieve dynamic updates and the human factors influencing how people use them. After proposing a user-centred classification of dynamic updates, this paper surveys the current state of technology from two perspectives: that of the developer, and those of visually disabled users. For the former group, the paper introduces some of the technologies that are currently available for implementing dynamic Web pages, before reporting on the results of experiments analysing current and historical Web pages to determine the extent of use of these technologies `in the wild' and the trends in their uptake. The analysis shows that for the most popular 500 sites, JavaScript is used in 93{\%}, Flash in 27{\%} and about one-third (30{\%}) use XMLHttpRequest, a technology used to generate dynamic updates. Uptake of XMLHttpRequest is approximately 2.3{\%} per year across a random selection of 500 sites and is probably higher in the most popular sites. When examining dynamic updates from the perspective of visually disabled users, first an investigation is reported into which technologies (Web Browser and assistive technologies) are currently used by this group in the UK: Internet Explorer and JAWS are clear favourites. Then, the paper describes the results of an experiment, and supporting anecdotal evidence, which suggests that, at best, most users can currently reach updated content, but they must do so manually, and are rarely given any indication that any update has occurred. With technologies enabling dynamic updating of content currently deployed in about 30{\%} of the most popular sites, and increasing annually, action is urgently required if visually disabled users are to be able to use the Web. The paper concludes by discussing some of the issues involved in making these updates accessible. },

abstract = {The World Wide Web (Web) is in constant evolutionary change. This evolution occurs along many fronts and is led by infrastructure developers, Web designers, technologists, and users. These multiple stake--holders ensure that the Web is a heterogeneous entity, not just in the nature of the content, but in the technology and agents used to deliver and render that content. It is precisely this heterogeneity which gives the Web its strength and its weakness. A weakness in technology adoption leading to an increasing disconnect between the actual user experience and the expected experience of the technology stakeholders. We are interested in the human factors surrounding the evolution of the Web interface; and believe that the wait is always too long for new accessibility recommendations, guidelines, and technology to be adopted. In this case, we describe a ten-year longitudinal study comprising approximately 6,000 home pages. From this study we conclude that as a `rule-of-thumb' mainstream technology is adopted at about 15{\%} within the first three years, incremental version releases are adopted at about 10{\%} within the first three years. However, sites which are most popular often exhibit enhanced adoption rates of between 10 and 15{\%} over the same period. In addition, we see that accessibility guidelines are mostly ignored with only a 10{\%} adoption rate after more than ten years. From this we infer that, for maximum accessibility adoption, guidelines might be supported and reflected in mainstream specifications instead of remaining only as a separate document.},

abstract = {The much vaunted Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolving into hybrid applications. Content that was once simple to surf is now becoming increasingly complicated due to the many updating components 'dotted' throughout the page. In previous studies, we have shown that unlike younger users, older users have more varied interaction patterns when using dynamic content. In addition, some older users are not aware of what to expect when interacting with dynamic content and show signs of hesitancy when completing tasks. Therefore, a tool was developed to assist older users as they interacted with these kinds of pages. The tool used simple language and video demonstrations to explain how the dynamic content operated and what users could expect to happen as they were interacting with it. We found that: older users tend to deny the need for assistance technology even when non-subjective measures suggest they do use it; technology assists but cannot replace initial human training; Assistance Tools are seen as a 'security blanket' incase things go wrong; and that the actual needs of users are not that well understood by those users.},

abstract = {Visual aesthetics enhances user experience in the context of the World Wide Web (Web). Accordingly, many studies report positive relationships between Web aesthetics and facets of user experience like usability and credibility, but does this hold for accessibility also? This paper describes an empirical investigation towards this end. The aesthetic judgements of 30 sighted Web users were elicited to understand what types of Web design come across as being visually pleasing. Participants judged 50 homepages based on Lavie and Tractinsky's classical and expressive Web aesthetics framework. A cross-section of the homepages were then manually audited for accessibility compliance by 11 Web accessibility experts who used a heuristic evaluation technique known as the Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method to check for accessibility barriers that could affect people with visual impairments. Web pages judged on the classical dimension as being visually clean showed significant correlations with accessibility, suggesting that visual cleanness may be a suitable proxy measure for accessibility as far as people with visual impairments are concerned. Expressive designs and other aesthetic dimensions showed no such correlation, however, demonstrating that an expressive or aesthetically pleasing Web design is not a barrier to accessibility.},

abstract = {The Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolve into hybrid applications, and content that was previously simple, now becoming increasingly complicated due to the many updating components located throughout the page. While beneficial for some users, these components (widgets) are often complex and will lead to confusion and frustration for others, notably those for whom accessibility is already an issue. While users and developers often perceive widgets as complete components (a Slideshow, or an Auto Suggest List), they are in-fact heterogeneous collections of code, and are therefore hard to computationally identify. Identification is critical if we wish to reverse engineer inaccessible widgets or `inject' missing `WAI-ARIA' into `RIAs'. In this case, we introduce a technique that analyses the code associated with a Web page to identify widgets using combinations of code constructs which enable uniquely identification. We go on to technically evaluate our approach with the most difficult widgets to distinguish between---Slideshows and Carousels---and then describe two prototype applications for visually impaired and older users by means of example.},

abstract = {The usability evaluation of small devices (i.e., mobile phones and {\{}PDAs{\}}) is an emerging area of research. Compared with desktop computers, designing a usability evaluation for small devices is more challenging. Context of use, such as environmental disturbance and a user's physical activities affect the evaluation results. However, these parameters are usually ignored or excluded from simple and unnatural evaluation settings; therefore generating unrealistic results. This paper presents a field study that investigates the behaviour of small device users in naturalistic settings. The study consists of a series of unobtrusive remote observations and interviews. Results show that small device users normally use the device with just one hand, press the keys with thumb and make phone calls and send text messages while walking. They normally correct typing errors and use abbreviations. On average, small device users switch their attention between the device screen and the surrounding environment 3 times every 20 seconds, and this increases when they are walking.},

have been used within a series of experimental designs to measure the utility

checks -- based on the observed behaviour of 400 mobile users -- to ratify that
a controlled experiment is being perceived as natural by the user. While the
the design of the experimental route which the user follows is a major factor
in the experimental setup, without check validations based on unobtrusive
observed data there can be no certainty that an experiment designed to be
natural is actually progressing as the design implies.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (Web) has become the means of distribution and use of information by individuals around the world. However, access to this information by visually impaired people is limited due to the Web's visual complexity that implicitly helps sighted users understand and interact with the page content. A variety of usability and accessibility studies show that complicated Web page structure depends on the page composition and layout. During our research we will identify how Web page structural elements, including links, text, and images, interact with each other to produce a visually complex page. In addition we will determine whether pages that sighted users identify as visually complex are complex for visually impaired users as well.
ViCRAM is a project that will contribute to the Web Accessibility area by facilitating visually impaired users. We will study sighted users's behaviour and eye movement while interacting with a Web page to elicit their implicit knowledge of visual perception. A relationship will then be distinguished between sighted users' visual cognition and visually impaired users' coping strategies employed when interacting with Web pages. The project's objective is to create a framework that will be used to identify visually complex areas on Web pages for two purposes: to give feedback to visually impaired users regarding the presentation and visual layout of the page; and to help reduce the visual clutter of the page by using the framework as a guide for a Web page transcoding process.},

It encompasses technical aspects such as the assessment of conformance to standards and guidelines, as well as non-technical aspects such as the involvement of end-users during the evaluation process. Since Web accessibility is a qualitative and experiential measure rather than a quantitative and concrete property, the evaluation approaches need to include different techniques and maintain flexibility and adaptability toward different situations. At the same time, evaluation approaches need to be robust and reliable so that they can be effective. This chapter explores some of the techniques and strategies to evaluate the accessibility of Web content for people with disabilities.

abstract = {Access to, and movement around, complex online environments, of which the World Wide Web (Web) is the most popular example, has long been considered an important and major issue in the Web design and usability field. The commonly used slang phrase 'surfing the Web' implies rapid and free access, pointing to its importance among designers and users alike. It has also been long established that this potentially complex and difficult access is further complicated, and becomes neither rapid nor free, if the user is disabled. There are millions of people who have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Web accessibility aims to help these people to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with, as well as contribute to, the Web, and thereby the society in general. This accessibility is, in part, facilitated by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) currently moving from version one to two. These guidelines are intended to encourage designers to make sure their sites conform to specifications, and in that conformance enable the assistive technologies of disabled users to better interact with the page content. In this way, it was hoped that accessibility could be supported. While this is in part true, guidelines do not solve all problems and the new WCAG version two guidelines are surrounded by controversy and intrigue. This chapter aims to establish the published literature related to Web accessibility and Web accessibility guidelines, and discuss limitations of the current guidelines and future directions. },

abstract = {Travelling upon the Web is difficult for visually impaired users since the Web pages are designed for visual interaction. Visually impaired users usually use screen readers to access the Web in audio. However, unlike sighted users, screen readers cannot see the implicit structural and navigational knowledge encoded within the visual presentation of Web pages. Therefore, in a visually impaired user's environment, objects that support travel are missing or inaccessible. Our approach to remedy this is to annotate pages with an ontology, the Travel Ontology, that aims to encapsulate rich structural and navigational knowledge about these objects. We use Semantic Web technologies to make such knowledge explicit and computationally accessible. Our semi-automated tool, Dante identifies travel objects on Web pages, annotates them appropriately with the Travel Ontology and uses this to transform the pages to enhance the travel support. Thus Dante uses the Travel Ontology to enhance the travel experience of visually impaired users. This paper introduces the Travel Ontology, the annotation pipeline used in the annotation part of Dante and some transformation scenarios to illustrate how the annotations are used to guide the transformation of Web pages.},

Usually, these users have to rely on screen readers: applications that sequentially read the content of a web page in audio. Unfortunately, screen readers are not able to detect the meaning of the different page objects, and thus the implicit semantic knowledge conveyed in the presentation of the page is lost. One approach described in literature to tackle this problem, is the Dante approach, which allows semantic annotation of web pages to provide screen readers with extra (semantic) knowledge to better facilitate the audio presentation of a web page. Until now, such annotations were done manually, and failed for dynamic pages. In this paper, we combine the Dante approach with a web design method, WSDM, to fully automate the generation of the semantic annotation for visually impaired users. To do so, the semantic knowledge gathered during the design process is exploited, and the annotations are generated as a by-product of the design process, requiring no extra effort from the designer.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (Web) is in transition; a fundamental evolution of the model which underpins the traditional Web. This new Web, Web 2.0, is a mesh of enhanced semantics, push application widgets, and embedded scripting languages and was developed to pursue the promise of enhanced interactivity. The possible benefits of Web 2.0 are great, but it seems that without timely and prompt action disabled users will be barred from these benefits. Indeed, using sites such as: Flicker, YouTube, MySpace, Google Maps, and Google Portal will rapidly become 'off-limits' to disabled users. Semantic Web technologies have already shown themselves to be useful in addressing some issues of Web Accessibility. However, this new technology has not yet started to make its way into mainstream applications. Without change, will the benefits of the Semantic Web be lost? Will the promising enhanced interactivity of Web 2.0 technologies become increasingly inaccessible to disabled users? We pose the question: "Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web: Hindrance or Opportunity?"

These proceedings bring together a cross section of Web design, engineering and Web accessibility research. The papers included here report on developments on the Web 2.0 and Semantic Web, discuss the issues regarding the evolvement of the Web, and suggest cross-pollinated solutions.

Conventional workshops and conferences on accessibility tend to be single disciplinary in nature. However, we are concerned that this focus on a single participant group prevents the cross-pollination of ideas, needs, and technologies from other related but separate fields. As with the previous workshops, this year's conference is again crossdisciplinary in nature and brings together users, accessibility experts, graphic designers, and technologists from academia and industry to discuss how accessibility can be supported. Our aim is to focus on accessibility by encouraging participation from many disciplines. Views often bridge academia, commerce, and industry and arguments encompass a range of beliefs across the design-accessibility spectrum.},

abstract = {One of the most significant advances behind World Wide Web (Web) 2.0 is the ability to allow parts of a Web page to be updated independently. This can provide an exciting, interactive experience for sighted users, who are used to dealing with complex visual information. For visually impaired users, however, these pages may be confusing: updates are sometimes not recognised by screen readers, while in other cases they may interrupt the user inappropriately. The SASWAT project aims to develop a model of how sighted users interact with dynamic updates, and use this to identify the most effective ways of presenting updates through an audio information stream. Here, we describe a 'thin slice' through this project, focusing on one form of update --- the auto-suggest list. These provide the user with suggestions for entry into an input text field, updating with each character typed. Experiments with sighted users suggest that the suggestions receive considerable attention, and appear to offer reassurance that the input is reasonable. Suggestions that are further down the list are less likely to be viewed, and receive fewer and shorter fixations than those at the top. We therefore propose an implementation which presents the first 3 suggestions immediately and allows browsing of the rest.

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 18th International ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia 'Hypertext, The Web, and Beyond: Five Autonomous Programmes, One Unified Conference'. The conference takes place in the Manchester Museum in Manchester, UK. The museum is located within the University of Manchester campus in the centre of Manchester. The city also has a rich scientific and academic heritage, with The University of Manchester being the home to twenty Nobel Prize winners and of such academic achievements as the world's first stored programmable computer, the splitting of the atom and the world's largest steerable radio telescope.

This year we had a major increase in submissions on 2006, over both full technical papers, and posters and demonstrations. With submissions coming from over thirty countries across four continents from Belgium to Brazil, Italy to India, and South Korea to Sweden. With an acceptance rate of 35{\%} the quality of the conference is maintained but with submissions such as 'Towards Better Understanding of Folksonomic Patterns', 'Revealing the Hidden Ethnography of User Browsing Behavior', and 'Assembly Lines: Web Generators as Hypertexts' our submission topics are significantly broadening.

These changes are also echoed in our Keynote, After Dinner Keynote, and Closing Plenary. Our Keynote is Professor Carole Goble, Director of the myGrid project (the largest UK e-Science pilot project), producer of the widely-used Taverna open source application (now part of the Open Middleware Infrastructure Institute). She is also the co-director of the e-Science North West regional centre. Our after dinner Keynote is Professor Wendy Hall, Head of School at the University of Southampton's School of Electronics and Computer Science. She is the founding Head of the Intelligence, Agents, Multimedia (IAM) research group and has published over 350 academic papers. In 2003 Wendy was appointed President of the British Computer Society (BCS) and is one of the few females to hold a fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering as well as being made a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), awarded in 2000. Finally, we all know our Closing Plenary speaker Theodor Holm Nelson, credited with first use of the words hypermedia, transclusion, founder of Project Xanadu; here we also see his new work on CosmicBook, and understand his ideas for the future.

ACM Hypertext, as a conference series, has always maintained very high quality standards, combined with a fairly strict adherence to the research topic of Hypertext and Hypermedia. Not giving in to the "hypertext and the Web are just the same" hype has allowed the conference to maintain its high profile, albeit at the expense of submission and attendance numbers. Not wishing to compromise on quality ACM Hypertext has taken a turn for broadening its scope. This has resulted in the five "autonomous programmes" of ACM Hypertext 2007.

Hypertext is everywhere, in theory research, in very practical applications, in society, in personal interfaces and in culture and communication. Separate program committees evaluated submissions in each of these tracks, resulting in a selection of high quality full and short papers that offer the conference attendees a varied but in depth view of current hypertext research.

Throughout the history of the ACM Hypertext Conference, researchers have tried to capture what hypertext really is. The Hypertext Models and Theory programme specifically targets this "hard core" formal study of structural, sculptural, spatial, open, dynamic and adaptive or any other type of hypertext (or Web-based Information System). The Models and Theory track has indeed attracted some visionary submissions that shape the future of WIS and hypertext systems and thus will become standard reference material in the future.

Hypertext is alive and in use in various applications. The Practical Hypertext programme looked at collecting some of these applications of hypertext including The Web, Semantic Web, Web Engineering, and Web Design. These topics concern themselves with all aspects of making valuable everyday hypertext applications, not exclusively on the Web. As a result, the track has gathered a variety of papers which illustrate classical issues in practical hypertext, such as reverse linking, interesting hyperspace applications such as hyperspeech, user-assisted similarity estimation on the web, and lessons learnt from industrial semantic web applications and learning style applications.

The inclusion of "Social Hypertext" this year as an explicit theme of the conference reflects the fact that this area has reached maturity. What is Social Hypertext? We might define it as Hypertext that gets better the more people use it - but Tim Berners-Lee would be the first to point out that this is exactly what the Web is. This year we made a specific effort to recruit committee members and reviewers from emerging research communities involved in technologies such as wikis and blogging and we circulated the Call for Papers within these communities. The predominant research issue that was most evident in the excellent set of papers we reviewed was that of analysis of the patterns of use of social software sites, but the area continues to evolve, and the committee's selection of papers reflects the width of the area. We hope to see this theme expand further in the future.

The focus of Hypertext and the Person is on a human centered Web, with an eye towards enabling all users, including those with disabilities to benefit from hypertext and hypermedia. Usability and accessibility are stressed, with a diverse set of issues explored. Papers in this track address hypertext navigation, adaptations for individual needs, educational applications, and collaborative hypermedia.

When the first ACM Hypertext Workshop convened twenty years ago, most researchers believed that the chief obstacles to widespread use of hypertext were technical and economic. Could systems perform sufficiently quickly? Could link integrity be achieved? Could society conceivably afford the cost of a digital library? At the same time, we assumed that, once the systems were designed and built, actually writing hypertexts would be a straightforward task.

Today, the most daunting engineering challenges have been met, although new challenges always arise. However, the craft of hypertext writing poses many unexpected challenges. The study of hypertext fiction is a staple of university curricula throughout the world, but it is clear that we are only beginning to understand the theory of hypertext rhetoric and the practice of hypertext criticism. From the details of semantic metadata to the grand vistas of the curation of digital artifacts, and from the workaday world of microformats and weblog networks to the abstract realms of metafiction, sculptural, and feral hypertext, hypertext's impact on culture is as undeniable as it is, still, incompletely understood.},

People are led to believe that computers, with the 'net' as their focus, are their portal to other worlds, their communication mechanism to remote peoples, 'blogging' their primary form of self expression. All this is in part true, but we think there are fundamental issues that are not addressed. The focus on only the virtual is skewing our perception to over-estimate the Web's importance. The increased complexity inherent in all large systems will become too great for many users as the Web develops and grows. The local environment, often most pertinent to the user, is currently completely ignored with regard to dynamic information giving. The Web's focus on information belies the fact that the world is also composed of physical artifacts. Therefore, we think that the next direction for the Web is the conjoining of the physical and virtual. We suggest that they must be connected because without a physical presence the virtual world cannot attain its full potential. To reduce the complexity and stress placed on the user, the Web should relate to the users' physical location and real-world artifacts encountered to make meaningful choices about what information is currently useful or required. In effect, the user acquires a real-world centric view of the Web in which the Web conforms to reality, not reality to the Web. The primary goal of our system, 'proXimity', is to augment realities by giving hypertext, and thus the Web, a physical presence in the real world.},

abstract = {Layout and structure are key to good visual design. They are the conduit for both the content and the graphics. Moreover, they are important for disabled people (e.g. dyslexic users) and specifically visually impaired users, as they need to be quickly and easily interacted with. The workshop aimed to address layout, structure, and presentation from the viewpoint of accessibility and good visual design; where these are in opposition, the workshop aimed to facilitate discussion between interested parties so that a solution (or at least the beginnings of a solution) can be formulated - in effect we ask the question 'Does Accessible Mean Dull?'. We support inclusive design; however, how can this be the case if users have differing needs? The organisers also assert that no one should be hindered when interacting with layout. Will making layout accessible hinder sighted or 'conventional' users? Conventional workshops on accessibility tended to be single disciplinary in nature. However, we were concerned that a single disciplinary approach prevents the cross-pollination of ideas, needs, and technologies from other related but separate fields. The workshop was therefore, decidedly cross disciplinary in nature and brought together users, accessibility experts, graphic designers, and technologists from academia and industry to discuss how accessibility could be supported. We also encouraged the participation of users and other interested parties as an additional balance to the discussion. Views often bridged academia, commerce, and industry, and arguments encompassed a range of beliefs across the design accessibility spectrum. Our aim was to focus on accessibility by encouraging participation from many disciplines, represented in the following discussion and paper abstracts.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (Web) is a visually complex, dynamic, multimedia system that can be inaccessible to people with visual impairments. SADIe addresses this problem by using Semantic Web technologies to explicate implicit visual structures through a combination of an upper and lower ontology. This is then used to apply transcoding to a range of Websites. This paper describes a user evaluation that was performed using the SADIe system. Four users were presented with a series of Web pages, some having been adapted using SADIe's transcoding functionality and others retaining in their original state. The results of the evaluation showed that providing answers to a fact based question could be achieved more quickly when the information on the page was exposed via SADIe's transcoding. The data obtained during the experiment was analysed and shown to be statistically significant. This suggests that the transcoding techniques offered by SADIe can assist visually impaired users accessing content on the Web.},

abstract = {Movement, or mobility, is key to the accessibility, design, and usability of many hypermedia resources (websites); and key to good mobility is context and preview by probing. This is especially the case for visually impaired users when a hypertext anchor is inaccurately described or is described out of context. This means confusion and disorientation. Mobility is similarly reduced when the link target of the anchor has no relationship to the expected information present on the hypertext node (web-page). We suggest that confident movement with purpose, ease, and accuracy can only be achieved when complete contextual information and an accurate description of the proposed destination (preview) are available. Our past work (1) deriving mobility heuristics from mobility models, (2) transforming web-pages based on these heuristics, and (3) building tools to analyse and access these transformed pages; has shown us that a tool to expand context and preview would be useful. In this paper we describe the development of such a middleware tool to automatically and dynamically annotate web-pages with additional context information present within the page, and preview information present within hypertext link destinations found on the page.},

abstract = {Web site evaluation methodologies and validation engines take the view that all accessibility guidelines must be met to gain compliance. Problems exist in this regard as contradictions within the rule set may arise, and the type of impairment or its severity is not isolated. The Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method goes someway to addressing these issues by enabling barrier types derived from guidelines to be applied to different user categories such as motor or hearing impairment, etc. In this paper, we use set theory to create a validation scheme for older users by combining barrier types specific to motor impaired and low vision users, thereby creating a new "older users" category from the results of this set addition. To evaluate this approach, we have conducted a BW study with four pages, 19 expert and 49 non-expert judges. This study shows that the BW generates reliable data for the proposed aggregated user category and shows how experts and non-experts evaluate pages differently. The study also highlights a limitation of the BW by showing that a better aggregated user category would have been created by having a severity level of disability for different impairment types. By extending the BW with these impairment levels, we argue that the BW would become more useful for validating Web pages when dealing with users which multiple disabilities and thus we would be able to create a "Personalised Validation and Repair" method.},

abstract = {We suggest that with the advent of ambient devices, pervasive computing systems, mobile user devices and the associated move towards accessing mobile information the HCI community has a perfect opportunity to influence the design of mobile interfaces early in their life-cycle. The Sentinel activity (part of the wider proXimity project) seeks to de-couple the interface (siren) from the ambient object (fire alarm) and place that interface with the user's mobile device (PDA, 'Braille n Speak'). The user device is specific to that user and so too is the interface; however, the problem of static interface creation (normally by sighted designers) still exists. If we are truly to make access to the real world a universal activity the presentation of the interface (buttons, sliders, etc.) must be separated from the functionality of the device, and therefore the functionality the interface is required to fulfil (data and control instructions). Sentinel aims to address this issue by using functional prototypes (written in XML) to separate these two areas. It does this without specifying the type of interface-control (button, tick-box, etc.) required and instead delegates the interface-control presentation task to the user-device which can more individually react to the accessibility needs of its user.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (Web) is changing. The much vaunted Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolving into hybrid applications. Content that was once simple is now becoming increasingly complicated due to the many updating components located throughout the page. The information overload and visual complexity of such components is significant. This increased complexity can produce lower performance and higher levels of stress and frustration which negatively effect the user. In previous work we have shown how galvanic skin response (GSR) measurements, collected in tandem with eye-tracking data, can be used as a method for determining how stressed users become when interacting with content. The results of that study demonstrated that when used appropriately, the presence of Web 2.0 content can reduce GSR measurements and be of benefit to users. In this work, the previous study was repeated with twenty-three older Web users to establish if similar patterns of interaction could be established. The results reveal that while older participants made use of dynamic content, unlike previous participants, they were a non-homogenous group with a large variance in the GSR measurements. We assert that a cause of this is hesitancy and therefore developing techniques to reduce hesitancy will benefit older users when interacting with Web 2.0 content.},

This paper describes empirical work which makes the link between the behaviour of motor impaired desktop users and non-impaired users of small-devices. This is important because it may, therefore, be possible to leverage existing solu- tions for motor-impaired users into the small-device domain. We find that there is significant overlap in the extent of the problems encountered, but not the magnitude. Eight of the 11 existing errors made by motor-impaired users were also present in our small-device study in which two additional error types, key ambiguity and landing errors, were also observed. In addition, small-device rates for common error types were higher than those of desktop users with no impairment, but lower than those of desktop users with motor impairments. We suggest that this difference is because all users were seated to maintain constancy between studies and assert that this magnitude difference will equalise once the small-device is used in a mobile context.},

abstract = {Visually impaired users are hindered in their efforts to access the largest repository of electronic information in the world, namely the World Wide Web. A visually impaired user's information and presentation requirements are different from those of a sighted user, in that they are highly individualized and nonvisual. These requirements can become problems in that the Web is visual-centric with regard to presentation as well as information order and layout. This can and does hinder users who need access to information but cannot take advantage of the visual cues available to sighted users. Our objective is to address these problems by creating usable and appropriately 'displayed' Web pages for all users who wish to understand the meaning of the information, as opposed to its presentation and order. We assert that the only way to accomplish this is to encode the semantic information of the page directly into the page. In this paper we describe work toward a low-overhead system to enable just this kind of semantic encoding. In particular, our approach allows semantics-based triage, that is, prioritized removal of unnecessary information from the presentation of a Web site, to make the interaction of visually impaired users with that site more productive. },

abstract = {Welcome to ASSETS 2008, the Tenth International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility! This year's meeting continues the tradition started in Marina del Rey, in 1994, which has become an annual event since 2004. In 2008 ASSETS continues to be the premier international gathering of researchers, practitioners, educators, and students involved in the application of computing and information technologies to provide assistive systems to people with special needs, and the development of computing technologies and their use by people with disabilities. The conference's activities provide a rich source of information and motivation for anyone interested in the promotion of accessibility, at diverse levels.

The opening keynote will be provided by Professor Ronald M. Baecker, Bell Chair in Human-Computer Interaction, University of Toronto, who will talk about the design of technology to aid cognition. The podium presentations include 29 full-length technical papers selected from 79 submissions, which have been organized in 10 thematic sessions. Attendees will have the opportunity to examine late-breaking results, as well as work-in-progress and practical implementations of research projects through 34 posters and demonstrations, selected from 49 submissions in a session chaired by Chieko Asakawa and Hironobu Takagi. These proceedings contain a 2-page abstract from each one of these posters and demonstrations. Both technical papers and poster/demonstration papers were subjected to a competitive peer-review process, ensuring that the papers included in these proceedings represent the state-of-the-art in the discipline. Nine rising new stars of the accessibility field have been selected to bid for the top prize of the Microsoft Student Research Competition, chaired by Matt Huenerfauth and Pawan Lingras. These students have submitted 2-page abstracts of their work (included in these proceedings), and will present their projects in posters during designated sessions at the conference. Additionally, the Doctoral Consortium, chaired by John Black and Giorgio Brajnik, will allow 11 doctoral students to share and discuss their research with a panel of established accessibility researchers.

The themes covered by the papers chosen for presentation at ASSETS this year show some interesting trends. As our understanding and awareness of cognitive and memory functions, and their disruptions, increase, accessibility researchers are addressing new challenges in these areas, which is reflected in the program and the keynote presentation. It is no surprise that the work in the area of Web accessibility continues to be an important focus of the conference, as the Web has become such an incredible outlet for different types of participation of individuals in society. However, while many forms of social participation may be just a web page away, the efforts to make it accessible to all are still ongoing, and some important contributions are described in these proceedings. This year's program includes a session that explores the use of the Web, and the pervasiveness of electronic personal communication media, to prospectively allow anyone to contribute to the development of shared accessibility resources. Information is power, and these new approaches aim at the future use of electronic communication networks to allow anyone interested to "donate" information that will empower individuals who face accessibility barriers.

This is all taking place at a time in which the technological capabilities that our research community can bring to bear to address accessibility challenges (processing speed, storage capacity, power efficiency, size reduction, component affordability) continue to improve, promising to propel even more imaginative solutions to accessibility problems in the near future. It is an exciting time for accessibility research, and we hope that this excitement will permeate the halls at ASSETS 2008 and that you become part of it.},

abstract = {This paper presents an eye-tracking study that examines how people use the visual elements of Web pages to complete certain tasks. Whilst these elements are available to play their role in these tasks for sighted users, it is not the case for visually disabled users. This lack of access to some visual elements of a page means that visually disabled users are hindered in accomplishing these tasks. Our previous work has introduced a framework that identifies these elements and then reengineers Web pages such that these elements can play their intended roles in an audio, as well as visual presentation. To further improve our understanding of how these elements are used and to validate our framework, we track the eye movements of sighted users performing a number of different tasks. The resulting gaze data show that there is a strong relationship between the aspects of a page that receive visual attention and the objects identified by our framework. The study also shows some limitations, as well as yielding information to address these short-comings. Perhaps the most important result is the support provided for a particular kind of object called a Way Edge - the visual construct used to group content into sections. There is a significant effect of Way Edges on the distribution of attention across tasks. This is a result that not only provides strong evidence for the utility of re-engineering, but also has consequences for our understanding of how people allocate attention to different parts of a page. We speculate that the phenomenon of 'Banner Blindness' owes as much to Way Edges, as it does to colour and font size.},

abstract = {The visual complexity of Web pages is much talked about; 'complex Web pages are difficult to use', but often regarded as a subjective decision by the user. This subjective decision is of limited use if we wish to understand the importance of visual complexity, what it means, and how it can be used. We theorise that by understanding a user's visual perception of Web page complexity we can understand the cognitive effort required for interaction with that page. This is important because by using an easily identifiable measure, such as visual complexity, as an implicit marker of cognitive load we can design Web pages which are easier to interact with. We have devised an initial empirical experiment, using card sorting and triadic elicitation, to test our theories and assumptions; and have built an initial baseline sequence of 20 Web pages along with a library of qualitative and anecdotal feedback. Using this library we define visual complexity, ergo perceived interaction complexity, and by taking these pages as 'prototypes' and ranking them into a sequence of complexity, we are able to group them into: simple; neutral; and complex. This means we can now work toward a definition of visual complexity as an implicit measure of cognitive load.

abstract = {Evidence suggests that concertina browsers -- browsers with the facility to expand and contract sections of information -- are important in providing the reader with an enhanced cognition of small to medium amounts of information. These systems have been shown to be useful for visually disabled users surfing the World Wide Web (Web), and with the development of the Mobile Web, there has been renewed interest in their use. This is due to the similarities of reduced or constrained vision found to exist between visually impaired users and the users of mobile devices. The cognition of information fragments is key to the user experience and the reduction of `information overload'; as such we are concerned with assisting designers of concertina browsers in providing an enhanced user experience by ascertaining user preference through a formative evaluation of concertina summaries. This aspect of browsing is important because in all concertina systems there is a distinct cognition speed/depth trade-off. Here we investigate a number of these concertina summarization techniques against each other. We describe a formative evaluation which concludes that users prefer concertina summarization of Web documents starting from 6.25{\%} slices of both the top and bottom and expanding from the top in 2{\%} steps to a target maximum of 18.50{\%} (being 12.25{\%} from the top and 6.25{\%} from the bottom). These preferences were found to be representative of documents of less than 600 words of content, and included the preference to not fragment an individual sentence even if that meant slightly increasing the target: Starting, maximum, and step percentage slices.},

By likening web-travel to real-world travel in terms of mobility, navigation, orientation, and mapping, and by fitting web-travel into a real-world travel framework a number of similarities can be identified, and problems characterised.

abstract = {This paper proposes the inclusion of travel and mobility in the usability metrics of web design. Hypertext design and usability has traditionally concentrated upon navigation and/or orientation. The notion of travel extends navigation and orientation to include environment, mobility and the purpose of the travel task. The presence of travel aids are important for all users, but particularly so for those with a visual impairment. This paper presents the ground work for including travel into web design and usability metrics by presenting a framework for identifying travel objects and registering them as either cues to aid travel or obstacles that hinder travel for visually impaired users. The aim is to maximise cues and minimise obstacles to give high mobility; measured by the mobility index. This framework is based upon a model of real world travel by both sighted and visually impaired people, where travel objects are used for orientation, navigation, route planning and survey knowledge. Knowledge of the differences in travel between visually impaired and sighted people will enable the model to be used in assisting the design of better user agents and web content for visually impaired and other users.},

abstract = {The rise of 'Web 2.0' has brought a much more interactive aspect to the Web: users are no longer just reading pages, but creating them, modifying them, and interacting with them. The Web is increasingly becoming the preferred means of communication, and particularly booking events and appointments; online personal and corporate diaries allow friends and colleagues to arrange meetings and coordinate activities. Many of these types of online activities require users to perform the apparently simple task of entering a date. For sighted people who have access to pop-up calendars, selecting a date is quick and easy. Unfortunately, this facility is not currently available to people with visual impairments, for whom entering a correctly formatted date can be a difficult and time-consuming task, with mistakes having potentially serious consequences. Here we describe the process by which we designed and evaluated an audio interface for entering dates. An eye-tracking study gave insight into how tabular calendars help sighted people enter dates, This understanding was used to design an audio interface that used the cognitive advantages of the visual design, rather than mimicking the visual representation. Iterative testing was followed by an evaluation using participants with visual impairments that highlighted the problems with manual date entry, and which showed the audio system to be effective and popular.},

abstract = {Visually impaired users are hindered in their efforts to access the largest repository of electronic information in the world, namely the World Wide Web (Web). A visually impaired users information and presentation requirements are different from a sighted user in that they are highly egocentric and non-visual. These requirements can become problems in that the Web is visually centric with regard to presentation and information order/layout, this can (and does) hinder users who need presentation-agnostic access to information. Finding semantic information already encoded directly into documents can help to alleviate these problems and support users who wish to understand the content as opposed to the presentation and order of the information. If this is to happen in the "real world", however, authors must incur no "design overhead" when creating documents. Our solution, Structural-Semantics for Accessibility and Device Independence (SADIe) involves building ontologies of Cascading Sytle-Sheets (CSS) and using those ontologies to transformWeb pages. In this way we find that we can indeed "tame" inaccessible Web pages},

A high level of mobility can be difficult for visually impaired and sighted individuals alike, especially when in unfamiliar and complex internal or urban environments such as airports, bus or train stations, shopping centres, and unfamiliar cities. Signage can help both groups (as long as it is appropriate), however complex environments seem to encourage complex and confusing signage that can handicap everyone. The problem is further complicated because signage is not descriptive, dynamic, or tailored to an individual's personal journey and therefore mobility.},

abstract = {The importance of the World Wide Web for information dissemination is indisputable. However, the 
dominance of visual design on the Web leaves visually disabled people at a disadvantage. Although 
assistive technologies, such as screen readers, usually provide basic access to information, the 
richness of the Web experience is still often lost. In particular, traversing the Web becomes a 
complicated task since the richness of visual objects presented to their sighted counterparts are 
neither appropriate nor accessible to visually disabled users. To address this problem, we have 
proposed an approach called Dante in which Web pages are annotated with semantic information to 
make their traversal properties explicit. Dante supports usage of different annotation techniques 
and as a proof-of-concept in this article, pages are annotated manually which when transcoded 
become rich. We first introduce Dante and then present a user evaluation which compares how 
visually disabled users perform certain travel-related tasks on original and transcoded versions 
of Web pages. We discuss the evaluation methodology in detail and present our findings, which 
provide useful insights into the transcoding process. Our evaluation shows that, in tests with 
users, document objects transcoded with Dante have a tendency to be much easier for visually 
disabled users to interact with when traversing Web pages.

abstract = {The Web is changing. The much vaunted Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolving into hybrid applications. Content which was once simple to surf is now becoming increasingly complicated due to the many updating components `dotted' throughout the page. The information overload and visual complexity is significant. However the sites most effected by these changes are often the most popular for social interaction. Sites such as Flicker, YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, and Google Maps, as well as portals such as Virgin, Yahoo, and Google Portal all rely on these new components and are all popular with older users. This increased complexity is a major problem for an ageing population of `knowledge workers' expected to work longer into old age. Indeed, we already know that seniors experience an increased cautiousness and a hesitancy about making responses that may be incorrect. In `noisy' information environments this increased complexity produces lower performance and higher levels of stress and frustration which negatively effect both work and social activity. Without a full understanding of the interaction of older people with Web 2.0 technologies the Web will rapidly become unable to support their interaction needs. Only by a deep understanding of this interaction can we propose assistive solutions. Therefore, our objective is to create a cognitive model of ageing users' Web 2.0 interactivity and suggest interventions, realised as an experimental assistive-advisor, to overcome their interactivity problems.},

However, while the number of older Web users increases, the opportunity to use the Web to its full potential is hindered through the combinatorial effects of ageing. To assist designers with the creation of accessible Websites, accessibility guidelines have been developed. While these guidelines have provided a basis for accessible design, Web site evaluation methods assume that all accessibility guidelines must be met. This can be challenging as different user groups will have different requirements that can sometimes be in conflict with each other. This is especially the case of older users who often have a number of mild impairments. The Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method addresses this issue by applying guidelines to different user categories. The BW method has so far investigated barriers for user groups such as blind persons; motor impaired users; and mobile phone users. Through an analysis of existing guidelines and literature surrounding the effects of ageing, we present a list of barriers faced by older users of the Web. These barriers can be used in conjunction with the BW method to assess the impact a Web page has on older users and their ability to interact with the content effectively.},

Our previous work has introduced a framework that identifies these elements and then reengineers Web pages such that these elements can play their intended roles in an audio, as well as visual presentation. To further improve our understanding of how these elements are used and to validate our framework, we track the eye movements of sighted users performing a number of different tasks. The resulting gaze data show that there is a strong relationship between the aspects of a page that receive visual attention and the objects identified by our framework. The study also shows some limitations, as well as yielding information to address these short-comings. Perhaps the most important result is the support provided for a particular kind of object called a Way Edge - the visual construct used to group content into sections. There is a significant effect of Way Edges on the distribution of attention across tasks. This is a result that not only provides strong evidence for the utility of re-engineering, but also has consequences for our understanding of how people allocate attention to different parts of a page. We speculate that the phenomenon of 'Banner Blindness' owes as much to Way Edges, as it does to colour and font size.},

abstract = {Movement, or mobility, is key to the accessibility, design, and usability of many websites. While some peripheral mobility issues have been addressed few have centred on the mobility problems of visually impaired users. We use our past work to address these issues and derive mobility heuristics from mobility models, use these heuristics to place mobility objects within a web page, and describe the construction of a prototype mobility instrument, in the form of a Netscape plug-in, to process these objects. Specifically, we likened web use to travelling in a virtual space, compared it to travelling in a physical space, and introduced the idea of mobility - the ease of travel - as opposed to travel opportunity. Our hypothesis is that travel and mobility within the web mirrors travel and mobility within real-world environments. We suggest that the Web community has typically concentrated on navigation and / or orientation rather than the whole travel experience, and that this neglect is crucial when dealing with browsing by visually impaired users. We therefore extend the definition of travel to mean: confident navigation and orientation with purpose, ease and accuracy within an environment.},

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that Web document summaries provide the sighted reader with a basis for making decisions regarding the route to take within non-linear text; and additional research shows that sighted people use 'Gist' summaries as decision points to bolster their browsing behaviour. Other studies have found that visually impaired users are hindered in their cognition of the content of Web-pages because users must wait for an entire Web-page to be read before deciding on it's usefulness to their current task. In these cases, we draw similarities between sighted and visually impaired users, in that sighted users cannot see the target of a Web Anchor and are therefore 'handicapped' by the technology. Previously, we have investigate four simple summarisation algorithms against each other and a manually created summary; producing empirical evidence as a formative evaluation. This evaluation concludes that users prefer simple automatically generated 'gist' summaries thereby reducing cognitive overload and increasing awareness of the focus of the Web-page under investigation. In this paper we focus on the development of 'FireFox' based tool which creates a summary of a Web page 'on-the-fly'. The algorithm used to create this summary is based on the results of our formative evaluation which automatically and dynamically annotates Web pages with the generated 'gist' summary. In this way visually impaired users are supported in their decisions as the relevancy of the page at hand. },

Finding semantic information already encoded directly into pages can help to alleviate these problems and support users who wish to understand the meaning as opposed to the presentation and order of the information.

To address such common errors, we propose migrating solutions from motor impaired to small--device users domain. To demonstrate the benefits of such solution migration, we propose a prototype system that encodes solutions for long key press error, bounce error, additional key error, and key ambiguity error.

Indeed, with the advent of Workflows, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), Representational state transfer (RESTful) services, and Cloud Computing we can also see these viewpoints becoming more common in mainstream thought. Here, we use Bernstein's concept of `NeoVictorian Computing' as a counterfoil to Andriole's new viewpoint of 21st century software development. We extrapolate from the Web development model into corporate and enterprise systems and propose an architecture of client based heterogeneous applications each tailored to a specific user, and their job, with highly interoperable data, controlled by workflows that are transferred with the data itself. We discount the new client--computing fad, as this really means centrally controlled, sometimes unavailable, old style enterprise systems. We suggest that by moving toward user centred agile systems we follow the conceptual, if not the technological, underpinnings of the Web. In this case we realise that Web developers are in a privileged position to shape and push forward this new kind of software architecture and the `craft' based approaches which will drive it.},

abstract = {After the launch of the Mobile Web Initiative at the World Wide Web Conference 2005 we are beginning to realise that, today, mobile Web access suffers from interoperability and usability problems that make the Web difficult to use. With the move to small screen size, low bandwidth, and different operating modalities, technology is in effect simulating the sensory and cognitive impairments experienced by disabled users within the wider population of mobile device users. In this our third workshop we ask the question "Is engineering, designing, and building for the mobile Web just a rehash of the same old Web accessibility problems?"These proceedings bring together a cross section of the Web design, accessibility and mobile Web communities. The papers included here report on developments, discuss the issues, and suggest cross-pollinated solutions.Conventional workshops on accessibility tend to be single disciplinary in nature. However, we are concerned that this focus on a single participant group prevents the cross-pollination of ideas, needs, and technologies from other related but separate fields. As with the first, this second workshop is decidedly cross disciplinary in nature and brings together users, accessibility experts, graphic designers, and technologists from academia and industry to discuss how accessibility can be supported. We also encourage the participation of users and other interested parties as an additional balance to the discussion. Our aim is to focus on accessibility by encouraging participation from many disciplines. Views often bridge academia, commerce, and industry and arguments encompass a range of beliefs across the design-accessibility spectrum.},

abstract = {Web Accessibility aims to help people with disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, interact, and contribute to the Web. There are millions of people who have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Currently most Web sites have accessibility barriers that make it difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use these sites. This half day tutorial provides a basic training to enable Web engineers to remove these barriers.

The tutorial is split into two parts of equal theoretical and practical training. In the first part you will learn how to build accessibility into your developments from the outset as part of the general development life-cycle; including understanding current research directions. This will involve lessons in: 'Understanding disability and thinking accessibly'; 'Practical engineering'; 'An Orientation around the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines'; 'Eclipse development Frameworks'; and 'Tools and techniques for accessible development'. In the second part you will learn about accessibility validation and repair as part of the debugging cycle along with new accessibility issues. This will involve lessons in: 'Debugging, validation, repair, and EARL', 'aDesigner and other debugging tools', 'Web 2.0, AJAX, Flash, and ARIA', and 'The Mobile Web and other mainstream technology'.},

abstract = {The visual appearance of a Web page influences the way a user will interact with the page. Web page structural elements (such as text, tables, links, and images) and their characteristics (such as colour and size) are used to determine the visual presentation and complexity level of a Web page. We theorise that by understanding a user's visual and aesthetic perception of a Web page we can understand the cognitive effort required for interaction with that page. This paper describes an investigation into user perception of the visual complexity and aesthetic appearance of Web pages. Results show a strong and high correlation between users' perception of visual complexity, structural elements (links, images, words and sections) and aesthetic appearance (organisation, clearness, cleanliness, interestingness and beautifulness) of a Web page. We argue that the results should be used as a further understanding for keeping the balance between aesthetic appearance of a Web page and its visual complexity. Web pages will then be designed that can still be aesthetically attractive but also usable and not overloaded with information for the users.},

information in the world, namely, the World Wide Web (web). A visually impaired user's informa- 
tion and presentation requirements are different from a sighted user's. These requirements can 
become problems in that the web is visually centric with regard to presentation and information 
order/layout. Finding semantic information already encoded directly into documents can help to 
alleviate these problems. Our approach can be loosely described as follows. For a particular cas- 
cading stylesheet (CSS), we provide an extension to an upper-level ontology which represents the 
interface between web documents and the programmatic transformation mechanism. This exten- 
sion gives the particular characteristics of the elements appearing in that specific CSS. We can 
consider this extension to be an annotation of the CSS elements implicitly encoded into the web 
document. This means that one ontology can be used to accuratly transform every web document 
that references the CSS used to generate that ontology. Simply one ontology accuratly transforms 
an entire site using a generalized programmatic machinery able to cope with all sites using CSS.

abstract = {Recently, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) upgraded its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from version 1.0 to 2.0. WCAG 2.0 further encourages the design of accessible Web content, and has been put in place to address the limitations of the earlier version, WCAG 1.0. The new development requires that updates be made accordingly. One of the areas affected by the transition is automated Web content accessibility evaluation and repair. Since most Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools (AERTs) depend on guidelines to make suggestions about potential accessibility barriers and proffer repair solutions, existing tools have to be modified to accommodate the changes WCAG 2.0 brings. In particular, more techniques for performing automated Web content accessibility evaluation and repair are desirable. The heterogeneous nature of Web content which AERTs assess, calls for techniques of cross-disciplinary origin. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the transition for automated evaluation and repair. In addition, we present a meta-review of relevant techniques from related disciplines for the purpose of informing research that surrounds testing and repair techniques employed by AERTs.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (Web) is in constant evolutionary change. This evolution occurs along many fronts and is led by infrastructure developers, Web designers, technologists, and users. These multiple stake-holders ensure that the Web is a heterogeneous entity, not just in the nature of the content, but in the technology and agents used to deliver and render that content. It is precisely this heterogeneity which gives the Web its strength and its weakness. A weakness in technology adoption leading to an increasing disconnect between the actual user experience and the expected experience of the technology stakeholders. We are interested in the human factors surrounding the evolution of the Web interface; and believe that the wait is always too long for new recommendations, guidelines, and technology to be adopted. We are therefore, currently focusing on technological interventions for the client-side experience as opposed to waiting for guidelines or core technology adoption. But our beliefs are nothing more than anecdotal, to accurately target our work we need to understand the way the Web evolves. In this paper we do not present any solid research evidence but wish to explain our rationale and methodology (our position), and expose this to comment and criticism from the research community.

However there are a few groups of users that are unable to direct the pointing device to the right location of the link. To make web accessibility for these users more friendly, access keys can be generated allowing users to navigate through websites with the keyboard in addition to other pointing devices. 

Research has been conducted on methods of automatically generating access keys for all web links on every web page. A formative evaluation has been conducted to obtain views of users regarding the use and feasibility of access keys from a user's perspective. Finally a system has been developed in Mozilla Firefox and been tested for both coding accuracy and user satisfaction.

abstract = {David tries not to use unfamiliar trains and buses, he doesn't travel to places he doesn't know, and he doesn't travel in unusual environments without a companion. David is visually impaired and in such cases he becomes disoriented from a lack of preview, knowledge of the environment, and orientation information and is consequently without the foundations on which to base mobility decisions. While his experiences are not always true for all visually impaired travellers they do represent the majority experience of David's peer user group. proXimity is our attempt to address David's travel problems and is based on our previous work in Hypermedia and Real-World Mobility. By using combined Hypertext
and mobility paradigms we move toward a system that will assist David in his travels. The primary goal of proXimity is to augment David's reality by giving hypertext a physical presence in the real world. We analogise the real and virtual, and so aim to provide Nodes (link targets), Links, and Anchors in the real world. Therefore, hypertext information that describes a physical location also has a physical presence and `local' physical
artifacts can be augmented by `remote' hypertext and semantic information.},

abstract = {Web Accessibility aims to help people with disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, interact, and contribute to the Web. There are millions of people who have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Currently most Web sites have accessibility barriers that make it difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use these sites. This half day tutorial provides a basic training to enable Web engineers to remove these barriers.

The tutorial is split into two parts of equal theoretical and practical training. In the first part you will learn how to build accessibility into your developments from the outset as part of the general development life-cycle; including understanding current research directions. This will involve lessons in: 'Understanding disability and thinking accessibly'; 'Practical engineering'; 'An Orientation around the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines'; 'Eclipse development Frameworks'; and 'Tools and techniques for accessible development'. In the second part you will learn about accessibility validation and repair as part of the debugging cycle along with new accessibility issues. This will involve lessons in: 'Debugging, validation, repair, and EARL', 'aDesigner and other debugging tools', 'Web 2.0, AJAX, Flash, and ARIA', and 'The Mobile Web and other mainstream technology'.},

abstract = {Layout and structure are key to good visual design. They are the conduit for both the content and the graphics. Being able to easily and quickly interact with the layout and structure is crucial for reading and understanding the content. This is particularly important for disabled people (e.g. visually impaired) as the layout and structure usually hinder them accessing the content rather than helping them easily interact with it. Conventional journals on accessibility tend to be single disciplinary in nature. However, we are concerned that a single disciplinary approach prevents the cross-pollination of ideas, needs, and technologies from other related but separate fields. This special issue is therefore, decidedly cross disciplinary in nature. It brings together a range of papers from the perspectives of users, accessibility experts, graphic designers, and technologists from academia and industry to inform how accessibility can be supported. To strengthen the cross-disciplinary nature of this special issue, we have also solicited the views and thoughts of nine world-renowned researchers all from related but different fields which mainly do not focus on the accessibility domain. We asked for their views on how accessibility affects them or (will) should affect them. Throughout the remainder of this introduction we will relate their thoughts and concerns to material selected for this special issue.},

Here, we suggest a Web based solution for rediscovering these reverse links, and develop a series of experiments to demonstrate our approach. Simply our algorithm involves parsing a Web server's log file, identifying each Web page viewed and saving an ordered list of referrers within a 'name-matched' XML file. This file is then used as a link point within a standard XHTML Web-page using a freely available Javascript library. While we have not performed any comprehensive user evaluation initial qualitative results suggest users are positive regarding our additions and that widespread adoption would increase user satisfaction due to constancy of the browsing experience.},

abstract = {Layout and structure are key to good visual design. They are the conduit for both the content and the graphics. They are also very important for disabled (e.g. dyslexic users) people and specifically visually impaired users, as they need to be quickly and easily interacted with. This workshop aims to address layout, structure, and presentation from the viewpoint of accessibility and good visual design; where these are in opposition, the workshop aims to facilitate discussion between interested parties so that a solution (or at least the beginners of a solution) can be formulated. We support inclusive design however how can this be the case if users have differing needs? The organisers also assert that no one should be hindered when interacting with layout. Will making layout accessible hinder sighted or 'conventional' users? Conventional workshops on accessibility tend to be single disciplinary in nature. However, we are concerned that this focus on a single participant group prevents the cross-pollination of ideas, needs, and technologies from other related but separate fields. This workshop is decidedly cross disciplinary in nature and brings together users, accessibility experts, graphic designers, and technologists from academia and industry to discuss how accessibility can be supported.

abstract = {We are concerned with aiding the mobility of visually impaired travellers around often complex and unfamiliar internal and urban environments. To do this we focus on a users interaction with ambient devices because these device types provide an easy entry point for visually impaired individuals to interact with their surroundings. By augmenting the physical environment with mobility focused ambient devices and making existing devices universally accessible our goal of easy, focused, and confident mobility can be achieved. We identify, through paper reviews and studies of empirical and anecdotal evidence, the social and technical problems that have so far barred consistent and cohesive development of an ambient mobility-network. We suggest that multi-model sensory-interaction with objects and assistive devices within an environment is the only way to accomplish easy, focused, and confident mobility for visually impaired travellers. We find that universal access to ambient devices does not exist when the user interface and the device functionality are conjoined. And we also suggest that this universal access will not occur if there are only benefits for one small minority user group.},

Designers, authors, and technologist are at present playing 'catch-up' with a continually moving target in an attempt to retrofit systems. In-fact engineering accessible interfaces is as important as their functionality's and should be an indivisible part of the development. We should be engineering accessibility as part of the development and not as afterthought or because government restrictions and civil law requires us to.

abstract = {A high quality of free movement, or mobility, is key to the accessibility, design, and usability of many 'common-use' hypermedia resources (Web sites) and key to good mobility is context and preview. This is especially the case when a hypertext anchor is inaccurately described or is described out of context as confusion and disorientation can ensue. Mobility is similarly reduced when the link target of the anchor has no relationship to the expected information present on the hypertext node (Web page). Confident movement with purpose, ease, and accuracy can only be achieved when complete contextual information and an accurate description of the proposed destination (preview) are available. We suggest that sighted people can benefit from additional context and preview information included in hyperlinks and disprove the empirical evidence that suggests these users do not benefit from link descriptions which have this enhanced information. We briefly describe a middleware system to automatically expand context and preview in link descriptions thereby 'fixing' terse links, links out of context, and inaccurate or inadequate preview information. Finally, we conduct a formative evaluation which shows us that a system to expand context and preview would be useful in different ways depending on the type of link.},

abstract = {Use the word 'accessibility' in the presence of any HCI specialist and they will immediately think of creating open interfaces that can be accessed both visually and audibly. Further, mention 'accessability' to any forward thinking group of Web developers and they will start to quote the Web Accessability Initiative Guidelines (WAI) and extol the virtues of accessability checking tools like 'Bobby'. Either way, both groups will focus on the obviously important area of 'sensory translation' but will miss one fundamental truth; profoundly blind people interact with their environment in a markedly different way from that of sighted individuals. We have realized that the ease of movement (mobility) around systems and information space (the hypertext/Web docuverse) is central to good accessibility; and that to achieve this we require additional mobility semantics within systems and information as a way of enhancing the user experience. By adding small amounts of information to existing Web pages (semi-) automatically, we can show significant improvements in the amount of information profoundly blind users are able to access in a given time; in effect 'levelling the playing field' with sighted users. This paper discusses our work and demonstrates how we can make such a claim. },

abstract = {The rapid advancement of World Wide Web (Web) technology and constant need for attractive Websites produce pages that hinder visually impaired users. We assert that understanding how sighted users browse Web pages can provide important information that will enhance Web Accessibility, especially for visually impaired users. We present an eye tracking study where sighted users' browsing behaviour on nine Web pages was investigated to determine how the page's visual clutter is related to sighted users' browsing patterns. The results show that salient elements attract users' attention first, users spend more time on the main content of the page and users tend to fixate on the first three or four items on the menu lists. Common gaze patterns begin at the salient elements of the page, move to the main content, header, right column and left column of the page and finish at the footer area. We argue that the results should be used as the initial step for proposing guidelines that assist in designing and transforming Web pages for an easier and faster access for visually impaired users.

As the SIG sees' it's numbers stable but it's student numbers converting to professional memberships decline, how can we stem the tide. It's time to think differently about what it means to be part of the SIGWEB community, we must move away from a culture of benefits to a culture of community. I think this means some pretty serious changes to how we think of ourselves as a community and entails a move to place more emphasis on social capital, the advantage created by a person's location in the relationships of the SIGWEB community. Indeed, for a community originally named 'SIGLINK' these interpersonal relationships seem even more relevant. So how to proceed? Well, I'd like to start a discussion about this topic with all members of the SIG through our 'Google--Group' URL at: http://groups.google.com/group/sigweb-community.},

abstract = {The accessibility of application components is key to enhancing the usability, ergo the user experience, of profoundly blind computer users. However, this accessibility is hampered when platform independent applications are developed because the normal operating system / application interface is abstracted. This means that implicit information inferred by the operating system in platform specific builds is not available in platform independent developments. The current most common platform independent language is Java and the key interface environment for Java is a set of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) known as 'Swing'. Based on faults, identified from conducting systematic testing of Swing applications, we have developed a web-based programming manual for writing accessible Java applications and checking their accessibility. Here, we present the major points from this manual as an abridged set of programming checks to help programmers overcome many of the technical errors that lead to accessibility faults when programming Swing. },

abstract = {The 'Towel' project seeks to find solutions to problems encountered by both visually impaired and sighted users when travelling in the World Wide Web by leveraging solutions found in real-world mobility and applying them to the virtual world. Visually impaired users find mobility on the Web particularly difficult because of the reliance of hypermedia on visual layout and large viewable areas that facilitate and enhance sighted mobility. Hypertext design and usability has traditionally concentrated upon navigation to facilitate this mobility; consequently other aspects of travel are neglected and web mobility has suffered. Similarly, the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Guidelines do not take a holistic view of travel and therefore in both these cases a fully rounded view of mobility cannot be formulated. This paper presents the basis for these assertions by drawing analogies between real-world and virtual-world mobility, and then attempts to substantiate these analogies by conducting a pilot study of virtual mobility on a focus group of both sighted and visually impaired web users. Knowledge of the differences in travel between visually impaired and sighted people will enable the design of better user agents and web content for visually impaired users as well as the sighted community.},

abstract = {Previous studies have defined a new type of impairment in which an able-bodied user's behaviour is impaired by both the characteristics of a device and the environment in which it is used. This behavioural change is defined as a situationally-induced impairment and is often associated with small devices used in a mobile setting or constrained environment. Relatively little is known of its extent or the magnitude of the problems faced by the user. Here, we place the work that has been undertaken into a comparative framework of impairment in the context of data input. Our survey finds that 12 problems exist which define all impaired input and we look to understand the similarities and possible solutions in the new impairment group of small device users. For instance, from the literature, we find that users who are both situationally and motor impaired: press keys more than once, do not use enough force and so a key is not activated, and accidentally type keys in reverse order. A wealth of other errors exist in the motor impaired domain but work does not exist to support their existence in the situational domain. However, if commonalities exist for some -- it seems work should be enacted to uncover the commonalities of all. Establishing these possible commonalities is important because solutions from one domain can be leveraged into another thereby saving the need to reinvent interventions which already exist elsewhere.},

Therefore, in a visually impaired person's environment objects that support travel are missing or inaccessible altogether. We aim to enhance the experience of visually impaired Web travellers by using annotation and Semantic Web technologies. In [17], we have proposed a semi-automated tool which encodes techniques for the support of travel upon the Web. The main goal of this tool is to analyse Web pages to identify objects that support mobility and travel, discover their roles, annotate them and transform pages based on these annotations to enhance the provided mobility support. This paper mainly presents the annotation part of the tool and provides some transformation examples which are based on the annotations. The main message of this paper is that visually impaired Web users could also benefit from the Semantic Web technologies and here we demonstrate a possible approach to achieve that.},

abstract = {
Small devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) are widely used to access the World Wide Web (Web). However, accessing the Web from small devices is affected by poor interface bandwidth, such as small keyboards and limited pointing devices. There is little empirical work investigating the input difficulties caused by such insufficient facilities, however, anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a link between able-bodied users of the mobile Web and motor impaired users of the Web on desktop computers. This being the case we could transfer the solutions which already exists for motor impaired users into the mobile Web and vice versa. This paper presents a user study that investigates the input errors of mobile Web users in both typing and pointing. The study identifies six types of typing errors and three types of pointing errors shared between our two user domains. We find that mobile Web users often confuse the different characters located on the same key, press keys that are adjacent to the target key, and miss certain key presses. When using a stylus, they also click in the wrong places, slide the stylus during multiple clicks, and make errors when dragging. Our results confirm that despite using different input devices, mobile Web users share common problems with motor impaired desktop users; and we therefore surmise that it will be beneficial to transfer available solutions between these user domains in order to address their common problems.},

abstract = {The advent of Web 2.0 technologies has allowed once static Web documents to be transformed into online interactive applications. To facilitate the accessibility of this dynamic content, Google have developed the AxsJAX framework that can insert Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) statements into the content dynamically. Such statements allow assistive technologies to interact with dynamic content and make it accessible to users. SADIe is an approach that uses semantic annotations of a Website's Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to drive a transformation process that can improve access to Web pages for visually impaired users who use a screen reader. Previously SADIe transcoded static pages by refactoring the content into a format more suited to the sequential audio output of a screen reader. In this paper we present a prototype SADIe transcoder that uses CSS annotations to generate AxsJAX framework code and insert it into Web pages. Such an approach allows users to access static content using a consistent set of key presses in a manner akin to an online application. This demonstrates the flexibility of the SADIe approach as the same annotations can be used to generate an alternative transcoding format. It also supports the use of SADIe as a lightweight method for allowing Web designers to make use of AxsJAX without requiring knowledge of the underlying AxsJAX technologies.},

abstract = {Visually impaired users are hindered in their efforts to access the largest repository of electronic information in the world, namely the World Wide Web (Web). A visually impaired user's information and presentation requirements are different from a sighted user in that they are highly egocentric and non-visual. These requirements can become problems in that the web is visually centric with regard to presentation and information order / layout, this can (and does) hinder users who need presentation-agnostic access to information. Encoding semantic information directly into pages can help to alleviate these problems and support users who wish to understand the meaning as opposed to the presentation and order of the information. If this is to happen in the 'real world', however, authors must incur no 'semantic overhead' when creating pages. In addition, resistance will be encountered to measures that threaten to compromise web design. In this paper we describe preliminary work towards an approach enabling a low-cost, lightweight solution to semantic encoding.},
