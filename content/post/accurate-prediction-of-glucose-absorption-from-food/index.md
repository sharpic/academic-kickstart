Help people with Type 1 Diabetes better manage their condition. Better management reduces clinical risks.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas to be destroyed, preventing the body from being able to produce enough insulin to adequately regulate blood glucose levels. Insulin is a hormone required for the body to use blood sugar. There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Treatment with insulin is required for survival, and is usually given by injection just under the skin but can also be delivered by an insulin pump.

Important to reduce the clinical risk is an understanding of how to accurately predict glucose absorption from food. This is a wicked problem and there is, likely, no perfect solution, we are ‘simply’ trying to get as close as possible. Instrumental is an understanding of food carbohydrates, glycemic index, glycemic load, and the bioabsorption of food both singularly and in combination. In this case, you will contribute to our wider Type 1 work by formulating studies, algorithms, and research prototypes to accurately predict blood glucose levels from the food we eat.

You will investigate how we might understand the importance of ingredients; portion size, weight, and composition; carbohydrate estimation and approximation; and absorption. Success will be a system which is better than a human at estimating food absorption and blood glucose levels - including predictions of future levels - for a specific individual.
