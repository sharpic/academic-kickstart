**In Summary: I consumed 4.613 tonnes of CO2 which is the target amount for 2020; and, I think I need to set my 2020 target to 3.5 tonnes.**

So let's summarise 2019 and plan for 2020...

I have zero production costs for Housing (over 50 years old), Car (over 11 years old), Cycle (over 10 years old). Further, as part of this focus we have changed our energy supplier to ‘[Bulb](https://bulb.co.uk)’ energy:

‘Bulb is the UK's biggest green energy supplier. We provide all our members with 100% renewable electricity. For every unit you use, we make sure a unit is produced and put on the grid by a renewable source including solar, wind and hydro. Plus, our gas is 100% carbon neutral. 10% is green gas produced from renewable sources like food or farm waste. And we offset the rest of the gas we supply by supporting carbon reduction projects around the world.’ 

And so we have no CO2 footprint for energy in the house.

[Water also has a cost of about 0.79 gCO2/litre](https://oco-carbon.com/metrics/the-carbon-footprint-of-tap-water/) I’ve no clue how much we’ve used this year as we don’t have a metre. But the average water usage for a standard household in the UK is [about 164 m3 per year](https://www.onaverage.co.uk/consumption-averages/average-water-usage). Giving 164000 litres at 0.79 gCO2/litre = 129560 grams for 164000 litres or 0.12956 tonnes.

So on this basis for 2019

## The Plan

So this means that my 2019 consumption is tonnes of CO2 4.613 tonnes of CO2. The current amount a UK citizen consumes is [6 tonnes](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html) per year with a world average of 4 tonnes per year; there are big error bars on this as the variance runs from 2 tonnes to [15 tonnes](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html). You can see the [history laid bare by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita) at wikipedia. Now we can also see the [personal targets we should be aiming for](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/carbon-targets-for-your-footprint) and that I need to be at 3.3 tonnes by 2030 and 2.3 by 2040. So the first target is lose 1.3 tonnes in 10 years but let’s try to get to this faster. For 2020 I’m going to try and do this by reducing my car travel (by half) and my food waste (to 25%).

## A Return Trip to Spain

Just as a comparison I thought I'd look at longer journeys, in thsi case to the south of Spain.

By **Air** is 3600km return, costs 270kg of Carbon, costs ~£50 and takes 3 hours.

By **Car** is 5200 km return (Google maps), costs 1.2 tonnes of Carbon, costs **lots**, and takes around 23 hours.

By **Train** is 5200km return, costs ~210kg of Carbon (carbonfootprint.com), costs £250-£400 return (raileurope.com), and takes 47 hours and 4 changes.
