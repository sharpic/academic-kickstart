Today saw the conclusion of my first fully distributed academic conference. The W4A is home and required destination for all Web Accessibility (and accessibility in general) researchers, it co-locates every year with the much larger Web Conference, and moves around the world on a rotation of Europe, the Americas, and Asia; this year located in Taipai.
