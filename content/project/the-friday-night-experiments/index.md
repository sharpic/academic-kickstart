Andre and Kostya frequently held 'Friday night experiments' - sessions where they would try out experimental science that wasnâ€™t necessarily linked to their day jobs.

One Friday, the two scientists removed some flakes from a lump of bulk graphite with sticky tape. They noticed some flakes were thinner than others. By separating the graphite fragments repeatedly, they managed to create flakes that were just one atom thick. Their experiment had led to graphene being isolated for the very first time.

This playful approach is fundamental to how both Andre and Kostya work. It is seen as both a useful way of maintaining interest as well as a means of generating new ideas.
