Friday Night Experiments are those experiments and off hand projects which actually involve doing something but that are tangential to my 'real' work; or experiments I just expect to fail badly.

The term comes from Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov who frequently held what they termed 'Friday night experiments' - sessions where they would try out experimental science that wasn’t necessarily linked to their day jobs.

Indeed their Nobel winning work on graphene started out as a Friday night experiment -- the phrase used in the Geim lab to describe investigations that were considered slightly crazy. The reference is to the time of week Geim first tried the experiment that led to his 2000 [Ig Nobel Prize](https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/winners/) ([levetating a frog](https://www.ru.nl/hfml/research/levitation/diamagnetic-levitation/)).

One Friday, the two scientists removed some flakes from a lump of bulk graphite with sticky tape. They noticed some flakes were thinner than others. By separating the graphite fragments repeatedly, they managed to create flakes that were just one atom thick. Their experiment had led to graphene being isolated for the very first time.

This playful approach is fundamental to how both Andre and Kostya work. It is seen as both a useful way of maintaining interest as well as a means of generating new ideas.

Honey Bees are the main pollinators of flowering plants, and according to Defra’s 2011 Governmental report ‘Biodiversity dependencies on pollinators’ pollination by insects is essential to maintaining plant genetic diversity. Biodiversity and plant diversity being a key component of both the RCUK GCRF Strategy, and is listed as topic 15 in the UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development (SDGs).

Honey Bees are also critically important for sustainable agriculture – another GCRF Strategy and Challenge Area. Globally, 9.5% of the total economic value of agricultural production for human consumption comes from insect pollination. This amounted to just under $200 billion in 2005. The value of crops pollinated by bees in the U.S. alone was estimated at $14.6 billion in 2000. Further, the UK Governments July 2013 report on The value of Bees to the economy estimates the economic value of pollinator services to be ‘in the order of hundreds of millions of GBP’; making it a key aspect of agri-food production both in terms of sustainability and food security.

However, honey bees face a number of natural and man-made environmental threats as detailed in the Defra ‘Contingency Plan for Plant and Bee Health in England 2017’. These threats place the environment, biodiversity, sustainability, and food security in question.

The BeeLife Platform is the University’s Research Apiary. Initiated in 2016 / 2017, with the intention of providing a test-bed for technical solutions which address these strategic threats and so support the GCRF Strategy and the UK Governments ’National Pollinator Strategy 2014-2024’. BeeLife is centred in Computer Science with 10 voluntary bee keepers – and a waiting list of 20 more – to perform weekly hive maintenance and record the ground truth of the hive(s) state.

Coalescing around this platform is an informal grass roots network of researchers across the University with an interest in social responsibility, sustainability, population health, agri-food, and food security and how technology can be leveraged to better address specific issues related to their research domain; or how designing technology for these end-application can push forward their technology. <a href="http://beelife.cs.manchester.ac.uk" title="Beelife Projects">More on the 'Beelife' Platform (offsite)</a> or more <a href="/categories/beelife" title="BeeLife Projects">on BeeLife musings on this site</a>.
