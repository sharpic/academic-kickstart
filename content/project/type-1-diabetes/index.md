Help people with Type 1 Diabetes better manage their condition. Better management reduces clinical risks.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas to be destroyed, preventing the body from being able to produce enough insulin to adequately regulate blood glucose levels. 

Insulin is a hormone required for the body to use blood sugar. There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Treatment with insulin is required for survival, and is usually given by injection just under the skin but can also be delivered by an insulin pump.

Important to reduce the clinical risk is an understanding of how to accurately predict glucose levels and blood glucose absorbtion. This is a wicked problem and there is, likely, no perfect solution, we are ‘simply’ trying to get as close as possible.
