The bedtime projects are those thoughts and ideas that come to us before our brain switches off for sleep. For me in that first hour, all of the unconscious craziness that I've been suppressing that day starts to make its way to the surface and ends up as a swirl of incoherent thoughts that if I'm lucky slowly coalesce into something meaningful (to me at least anyhow).

These ideas are never going to become anything more than thought pieces written as a story here and maybe catalyst's that I might use to change the way I do things, but they are not going to be tangible projects or anything you can really "touch".

## <a href="/categories/less" title="Less Projects">Less</a> 

It's become obvious that to address climate change and our worlds spiralling economic disconnects a lot of us are going to have to have less, build less, and want less. The key phrase here is 'want less' if we don't want less then we will never achieve systemic 'sticky' changes. Safe to say that we need to make 'less' a virture -- I really think this is coming. We need to want less but better -- things that let us reduce, by adding quality. <a href="/categories/less" title="Less Projects">'Less' is just a category that allows me to group my thinking about how I personally might go about this</a>.
