abstract: "Demographics indicate that populations are ageing and this trend is reflected in the number of older people now using the Web. However, while the number of older Web users increases, the opportunity to use the Web to its full potential is hindered through the combinatorial effects of ageing. To assist designers with the creation of accessible Websites, accessibility guidelines have been developed. While these guidelines have provided a basis for accessible design, Web site evaluation methods assume that all accessibility guidelines must be met. This can be challenging as different user groups will have different requirements that can sometimes be in conflict with each other. This is especially the case of older users who often have a number of mild impairments. The Barrier Walkthrough (BW) method addresses this issue by applying guidelines to different user categories. The BW method has so far investigated barriers for user groups such as blind persons; motor impaired users; and mobile phone users. Through an analysis of existing guidelines and literature surrounding the effects of ageing, we present a list of barriers faced by older users of the Web. These barriers can be used in conjunction with the BW method to assess the impact a Web page has on older users and their ability to interact with the content effectively."
