abstract: "The World Wide Web (Web) is in transition; a fundamental evolution of the model which underpins the traditional Web. This new Web, Web 2.0, is a mesh of enhanced semantics, push application widgets, and embedded scripting languages and was developed to pursue the promise of enhanced interactivity. The possible benefits of Web 2.0 are great, but it seems that without timely and prompt action disabled users will be barred from these benefits. Indeed, us- ing sites such as: Flicker, YouTube, MySpace, Google Maps, and Google Portal will rapidly become to make its way into mainstream applications. Without change, will the benefits of the Semantic Web be lost? Will the promising enhanced interactivity of Web 2.0 technologies become increasingly inaccessible to disabled users? We pose the question: papers included report on developments on the Web 2.0 and Semantic Web, discussed the issues regarding the evolvement of the Web, and suggested cross-pollinated solutions. Comments from our attendees suggested that they enjoyed the conference and would be participating again next year. Our social programme also attracted almost all of our delegates, which was a great fun. Overall we judge the conference to be a great success."
