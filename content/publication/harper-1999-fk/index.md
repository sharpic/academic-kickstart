abstract: "The 'Towel' project seeks to find solutions to problems encountered by both visually impaired and sighted users when travelling in the World Wide Web. Drawing similarities between real-world travel metaphors of visually impaired people and web-based travel metaphors of both visually impaired and sighted people, enhances an understanding of the problem and therefore enables solutions to these travel problems to be more easily identified. By likening web-travel to real-world travel in terms of mobility, navigation, orientation, and mapping, and by fitting web-travel into a real-world travel framework a number of similarities can be identified, and problems characterised. These problems have solutions in the real-world and so these real-world solutions may be of use in addressing web-based travel problems."
