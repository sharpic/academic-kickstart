abstract: "Â© 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM. The number of users required for usability studies has been a controversial issue over 30 years. Some researchers suggest a certain number of users to be included in these studies. However, they do not focus on eye tracking studies for analysing eye movement sequences of users (i.e., scanpaths) on web pages. We investigate the effects of the number of users on scanpath analysis with our algorithm that was designed for identifying the most commonly followed path by multiple users. Our experimental results suggest that it is possible to approximate the same results with a smaller number of users. The results also suggest that more users are required when they serendipitously browse on web pages in comparison with when they search for specific information or items. We observed that we could achieve 75% similarity to the results of 65 users with 27 users for searching tasks and 34 users for browsing tasks. This study guides researchers to determine the ideal number of users for analysing scanpaths on web pages based on their budget and time."
