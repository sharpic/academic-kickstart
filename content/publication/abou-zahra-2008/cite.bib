 abstract = {Web accessibility evaluation is a broad field that combines different disciplines and skills. It encompasses technical aspects such as the assessment of conformance to standards and guidelines, as well as non-technical aspects such as the involvement of end-users during the evaluation process. Since Web accessibility is a qualitative and experiential measure rather than a quantitative and concrete property, the evaluation approaches need to include different techniques and maintain flexibility and adaptability toward different situations. At the same time, evaluation approaches need to be robust and reliable so that they can be effective. This chapter explores some of the techniques and strategies to evaluate the accessibility of Web content for people with disabilities. It highlights some of the common approaches to carry out and manage evaluation processes rather than list out individual steps for evaluating Web content. This chapter also provides an outlook to some of the future directions in which the field seems to be heading, and outlines some opportunities for research and development.},
