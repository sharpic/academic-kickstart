 abstract = {Personal mobility - mobility can be thought of as the ease as opposed to the opportunity for travel - is important not just for the implicit benefits of easy and accurate navigation and orientation, but also because it supports the less tangible factors of self worth, freedom, and independence. A high level of mobility can be difficult for visually impaired and sighted individuals alike, especially when in unfamiliar and complex internal or urban environments such as airports, bus or train stations, shopping centres, and unfamiliar cities. Signage can help both groups (as long as it is appropriate), however complex environments seem to encourage complex and confusing signage that can handicap everyone. The problem is further complicated because signage is not descriptive, dynamic, or tailored to an individual's personal journey and therefore mobility.},
