abstract: "Multi-headed reverse linking (incoming links) is a fundamental concept of Open Hypermedia Systems. However, this bi-directionality has been lost in the move to the World Wide Web (Web). Here, we suggest a Web based solution for rediscovering these reverse links, and develop a series of experiments to demonstrate our approach. Simply our algorithm involves parsing a Web server's log file, identifying each Web page viewed and saving an ordered list of referrers within a 'name-matched' XML file. This file is then used as a link point within a standard XHTML Web-page using a freely available Javascript library. While we have not performed any comprehensive user evaluation initial qualitative results suggest users are positive regarding our additions and that widespread adoption would increase user satisfaction due to constancy of the browsing experience."
