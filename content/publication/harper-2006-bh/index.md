abstract: "The Third W4A International Cross-Disciplinary Workshop on Web Accessibility was held on Monday 22nd and Tuesday 23rd May 2006 as part of the Fifteenth International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2006) located at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre. We ran over 2 days, welcomed 73 attendees, and were the biggest workshop at the conference. We accepted 41.6% of all submissions, each paper was peer reviewed by three of our programme committee. We published ISBN'ed proceedings as part of the ACM Digital Library, and eight of our authors have been invited to submit extended papers to the Springer Journal, Universal Access in the Information Society. Comments from our attendees, and our workshop evaluation questionnaires, suggested that they enjoyed the workshop and would be participating again next year. Our social programme also attracted 20 of our delegates. Overall we judge the workshop to be a great success. "
