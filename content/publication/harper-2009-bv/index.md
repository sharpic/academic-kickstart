abstract: "Recently, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) upgraded its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from version 1.0 to 2.0. WCAG 2.0 further encourages the design of accessible Web content, and has been put in place to address the limitations of the earlier version, WCAG 1.0. The new development requires that updates be made accordingly. One of the areas affected by the transition is automated Web content accessibility evaluation and repair. Since most Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools (AERTs) depend on guidelines to make suggestions about potential accessibility barriers and proffer repair solutions, existing tools have to be modified to accommodate the changes WCAG 2.0 brings. In particular, more techniques for performing automated Web content accessibility evaluation and repair are desirable. The heterogeneous nature of Web content which AERTs assess, calls for techniques of cross-disciplinary origin. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the transition for automated evaluation and repair. In addition, we present a meta-review of relevant techniques from related disciplines for the purpose of informing research that surrounds testing and repair techniques employed by AERTs."
