abstract: "Visually impaired users are hindered in their efforts to access the World Wide Web (Web) because their information and presentation requirements are different from those of a sighted user. These requirements can become problems as the Web becomes ever more visually centric with regard to presentation and information order / layout, this can (and does) hinder users who need presentationagnostic access to information. Finding semantic information already encoded directly into pages can help to alleviate these problems and support users who wish to understand the meaning as opposed to the presentation and order of the information. Our solution, Structural-Semantics for Accessibility and Device Independence (SADIe) involves building ontologies of Cascading Sytle-Sheets (CSS) and using those ontologies to transform Web pages."
