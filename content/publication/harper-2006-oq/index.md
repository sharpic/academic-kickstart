abstract: "Reciprocal Interoperability between the Accessible and Mobile Webs (RIAM) seeks to investigate ways in which to integrate together research into the Accessible and Mobile World Wide Webs (Web), to develop a common infrastructure, and to validate this infrastructure using existing Web documents and Mobile client simulators. RIAM will investigate the use of Web documents and parts of those documents in order to ensure device independence and place the Mobile Web in a position to access the entire Web. If the Web is accessible then it is also Mobile, and this will be validated by running a series of repeating experiments, testing the results of these experiments, and using the results to refine models and software tools."
