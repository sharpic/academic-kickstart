 abstract = {Our studies with small--device users show that they experience common input errors with motor impaired Desktop users. When small--device users are mobile their error rates increase to the same magnitude with, in some cases higher than, that of motor impaired desktop users. To address such common errors, we propose migrating solutions from motor impaired to small--device users domain. To demonstrate the benefits of such solution migration, we propose a prototype system that encodes solutions for long key press error, bounce error, additional key error, and key ambiguity error. This paper is different from other challenge papers as it does not demonstrate a prototype for disabled users, but it demonstrates how research and development for disabled users can benefit all.},
