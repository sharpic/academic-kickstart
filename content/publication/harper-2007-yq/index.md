abstract: "Conventional thought from the Semantic Web community equates the use of ontologies with the representation of the meaning of content. Here, we skew this viewpoint by describing our ontology, Web Authoring for Accessibility (WAfA), which investigates the way ontologies can describe the semantic structure of documents. By understanding the way heterogeneous XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Mark-up Language) documents are structured we can better transform documents, currently inaccessible to visually impaired users. WAfA performs two tasks: (1) it allows us to flexibly model an XHTML document within the context of navigation and orientation through the Web resource; (2) it enables non-expert users to quickly annotate a Web document by providing a `lingua franca' between author and Web Accessibility Domain Experts. Here we describe our ontology, its use, novelty, and importance."
