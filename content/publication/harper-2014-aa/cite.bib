 abstract = {Visually disabled people typically use methods of `sensory translation' to access data via assistive technology. These technologies conventionally render content under the direction of the user into a form that can be perceived by that user -- in effect the interface and content are adapted to suit their sensory requirements -- but simple sensory translation is not enough for big, broad and complex data. Why is this -- and how can things be better?},
