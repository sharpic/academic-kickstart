 abstract = {In our previous work, we extended the notion of travel to include environment, feedback and the purpose of the current travel task. Specifically, we likened web use to travelling in a virtual space, compared it to travelling in a physical space, and introduced the idea of mobility - the ease of travel - as opposed to travel opportunity. This paper describes our continuing work in building a prototype mobility tool to address some of these issues.},
