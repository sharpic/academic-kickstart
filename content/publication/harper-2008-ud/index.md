abstract: "The World Wide Web (Web) is a visually complex, dynamic, multimedia system that can be inaccessible to people with visual impairments. SADIe addresses this problem by using Semantic Web technologies to explicate implicit visual structures through a combination of an upper and lower ontology. By identifying elements within the Web page, in addition to the role that those elements play, accurate transcoding can be applied to a diverse range of Websites."
