abstract: "Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. A strength of IFML derives from its ability to support generation of a user interface by coupling data and control models. However, separation of concerns between different models (and in particular between models of control and of data) could be beneficial to better understand generation principles and expressivity limits, to support computation of design quality metrics, and to formulate intra-model transformation rules. In the paper we show that such a separation is indeed possible using UML class and state diagrams. We present the generation rules that a compiler follows for producing user interfaces. Based on the adopted representation, we argue that certain expressive limits are due to the underlying foundation common of our approach and of IFML."
