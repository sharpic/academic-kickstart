 abstract = {Disabled people typically use methods of `sensory translation' to access a Web-page via assistive technology. These technologies conventionally render screen content under the direction of the user into a form that can be perceived by that user -- in effect the interface and content are adapted to suit their sensory requirements -- but simple sensory translation is not enough.
Why is this -- and how can things be better? In this talk we touch on accessibility, sensory transcoding, multi-talker systems, auditory perception, and Neuroscience to help us in our search for equivalent interactive experiences tailored to the sensory modality of the user.},
