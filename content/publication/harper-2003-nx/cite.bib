 abstract = {We have previously shown that the mobility, or ease of travel, of visually impaired Web users is reduced since most Web pages are usually designed for visual interaction [7]. Therefore, in a visually impaired person's environment objects that support travel are missing or inaccessible altogether. We aim to enhance the experience of visually impaired Web travellers by using annotation and Semantic Web technologies. In [17], we have proposed a semi-automated tool which encodes techniques for the support of travel upon the Web. The main goal of this tool is to analyse Web pages to identify objects that support mobility and travel, discover their roles, annotate them and transform pages based on these annotations to enhance the provided mobility support. This paper mainly presents the annotation part of the tool and provides some transformation examples which are based on the annotations. The main message of this paper is that visually impaired Web users could also benefit from the Semantic Web technologies and here we demonstrate a possible approach to achieve that.},
