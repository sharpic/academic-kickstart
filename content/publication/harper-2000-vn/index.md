abstract: "The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for travel by visually impaired people in order to provide a basis on which to develop future mobility and orientation systems to support such travellers. The 'travel task' is reviewed, and then analysed in the context of visual impairment, leading to the development of a simple framework to describe how travel is accomplished. Once this framework has been developed it can be used as a means of examining travel and travel aids for visually impaired people so that inadequacies in the provision of these travel aids can be addressed."
