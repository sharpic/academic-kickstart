abstract: "The accessibility of graphics and multimedia should be considered from at least two distinct perspectives. First, in terms of the provision of sufficient information for people with disabilities that limit access to specific elements of the content. Second, graphics and multimedia can be thought of as equivalent alternatives to text for those with cognitive disabilities. This chapter looks at issues in the delivery of equivalent information and the preservation of essential content so as to serve the largest possible audience."
