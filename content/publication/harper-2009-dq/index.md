abstract: "The Web is changing. The much vaunted Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolving into hybrid applications. Content which was once simple to surf is now becoming increasingly complicated due to the many updating components `dotted' throughout the page. The information overload and visual complexity is significant. However the sites most effected by these changes are often the most popular for social interaction. Sites such as Flicker, YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, and Google Maps, as well as portals such as Virgin, Yahoo, and Google Portal all rely on these new components and are all popular with older users. This increased complexity is a major problem for an ageing population of `knowledge workers' expected to work longer into old age. Indeed, we already know that seniors experience an increased cautiousness and a hesitancy about making responses that may be incorrect. In `noisy' information environments this increased complexity produces lower performance and higher levels of stress and frustration which negatively effect both work and social activity. Without a full understanding of the interaction of older people with Web 2.0 technologies the Web will rapidly become unable to support their interaction needs. Only by a deep understanding of this interaction can we propose assistive solutions. Therefore, our objective is to create a cognitive model of ageing users' Web 2.0 interactivity and suggest interventions, realised as an experimental assistive-advisor, to overcome their interactivity problems."
