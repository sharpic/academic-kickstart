 abstract = {n 1891 master cutler Karl Elsener invented his first multi function tool, the `Offiziermesser', a soldier's knife designed to universally meet the needs of the soldier and woodsman. This officer's knife was renamed by American GIs1 in 1945 to the more commonly known `Swiss Army Knife'. Adopted by outdoor enthusiasts worldwide, its popularity has increased, as have the number of varieties and styles. The tool, which is designed-for-all your outdoor needs, and built so that one design is universally acceptable to all, now has over 100 combinations. One of the key ideas of making the World Wide Web (web) accessible to users with disabilities is this same idea of design-for-all, which so inspired Karl Elsener: a concept which proposes that every web page should be designed so that as many people as possible can access it, regardless of any sensory or cognitive impairments. However, design-for-all can mean many things to many people. Some discuss design in terms of the society at large, by making reference to socio economics, ethics, and issues of general discrimination. Others see design-for-all as a technological issue and a problem to be solved. Still others link design-for-all to a way of thought that should encompass everyone. In the context of computing and software development, many suggest that technology must focus on designing products so that they are usable by the widest range of people. Yet, in reality, every person is a unique individual and so this view cannot possibly be sustainable or achievable.},
