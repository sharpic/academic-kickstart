abstract: "Single Structured Accessibility Stream for Web 2.0 Access Technologies (SASWAT) is a tool that allows independantly updating micro contents to be accessible to disabled users. The planned architecture for this tool is a program that is positioned between the website and the accessibility tool of choice such as a screen reader that can interpret the requests sent between the webpage and its server and relay that information in a usable format using XML which can then be used by an accessibility."
