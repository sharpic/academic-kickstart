 abstract = {To be excluded from access to the Web is becoming and increasingly severe disadvantage. One potential cause of exclusion is to have a visual impairment. Technologies exist which can make the Web more accessible to such people, but those technologies depend to a large extent on the way the Web content is designed. This chapter gives an introduction to the underlying Web technology and then to the assistive technologies which have been developed to facilitate access, notably specialized non-visual browsers and screen reader/visual browser combinations. Speculation about the future suggests that technologically the picture is quite positive as access and mainstream technologies merge together. The technologies are not the whole answer though; accessible content will only be generated if and when website owners pay greater attention to the need for it.},
