 abstract = {Existing re-engineering, namely transcoding, techniques improved disabled and mobileWeb users experience by makingWeb pages more accessible in constrained environments such as on small screen devices and in audio presentation. However, none of these techniques use eye tracking data to transcode Web pages based on understanding and predicting users experience. The overarching goal is to improve the user experience in such constrained environments by using a novel application of eye tracking technology. Thus, this PhD research project aims to propose an algorithm to identify common scanpaths, which are eye movement sequences, and relating those scanpaths to elements of Web pages. It can then be used to transcode Web pages, for instance, unnecessary information can be removed. It is obvious that both visually disabled and mobile users would benefit from such development. © Springer International Publishing 2013.},
