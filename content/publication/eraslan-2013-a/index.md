abstract: "The main goal of this study is to develop an algorithm to identify a common scanpath in a given eye-tracking data. This paper provides a set of guidelines on how to develop such an algorithm. To develop these guidelines, we have conducted experiments with existing algorithms and investigated their strengths and weaknesses. The main purpose of creating a common scanpath is to guide the transcoding of web pages. Transcoded web pages would remove unnecessary information such that when they are accessed in constrained environments, for instance from mobile devices and screen readers, they save time and energy to users. © 2013 IEEE."
