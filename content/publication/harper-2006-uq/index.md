abstract: "Contemporarily, most computer environments are mouse or pointer based. This allows users accessing the Web to easily get to the link they require on web pages by pointing to the link and selecting it. However there are a few groups of users that are unable to direct the pointing device to the right location of the link. To make web accessibility for these users more friendly, access keys can be generated allowing users to navigate through websites with the keyboard in addition to other pointing devices.   Research has been conducted on methods of automatically generating access keys for all web links on every web page. A formative evaluation has been conducted to obtain views of users regarding the use and feasibility of access keys from a user's perspective. Finally a system has been developed in Mozilla Firefox and been tested for both coding accuracy and user satisfaction. "
