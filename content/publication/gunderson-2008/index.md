abstract: "Web browsers play an important role in the accessibility of the Web by people with disabilities. The features that Web browsers provide to control the rendering of content, navigate and orient to document structure, and control the automatic behaviors will determine the types of accessibility techniques Web authors can use to make their resources more accessible and the level of usability that will be available to people with disabilities in accessing Web resources. Web browsers play a critical role in accessibility as Web 2.0 widgets created out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScripting by supporting new W3C technologies to make Web applications more accessible."
