abstract: "Experience in World Wide Web (Web) accessibility has taught us: to think about small bespoke solutions; to tailor interaction and requirements to the user and job at hand; to value high data interoperability; to realise that large enterprise systems, become unmanageable and unable to change at the speed required by both users and technology; and finally, to value heterogeneity. Indeed, with the advent of Workflows, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), Representational state transfer (RESTful) services, and Cloud Computing we can also see these viewpoints becoming more common in mainstream thought. Here, we use Bernstein's concept of `NeoVictorian Computing' as a counterfoil to Andriole's new viewpoint of 21st century software development. We extrapolate from the Web development model into corporate and enterprise systems and propose an architecture of client based heterogeneous applications each tailored to a specific user, and their job, with highly interoperable data, controlled by workflows that are transferred with the data itself. We discount the new client--computing fad, as this really means centrally controlled, sometimes unavailable, old style enterprise systems. We suggest that by moving toward user centred agile systems we follow the conceptual, if not the technological, underpinnings of the Web. In this case we realise that Web developers are in a privileged position to shape and push forward this new kind of software architecture and the `craft' based approaches which will drive it."
