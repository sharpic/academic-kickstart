abstract: "The W4A Camp is an all day event set up to discuss accessibility research. Participants decide the topics to be discussed and they also organise the session during morning devoted to the camp. It is an adhoc unconference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcomed and invited to join. The first edition was organised after the ninth International CrossDisciplinary Conference on Web Accessibility (W4A 2012) in Lyon, France. There were around 30 attendees and four themes emerged which focused on 1. accessibility body of knowledge; 2. evaluation, conformity and certification; 3. breaking accessibility automation barriers and 4. mobile web and accessibility. This communication paper reports the experiences gained, lessons learnt, research areas discussed and major findings from the first edition of the W4A Camp. Copyright 2013 ACM."
