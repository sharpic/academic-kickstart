 abstract = {Transcoding web pages for ease of use for small screen device users and for disabled users have been researched extensively. However, there has been very little research on transcoding web pages based on understanding and predicting users' experiences. In this paper, we discuss the concept of experience-based transcoding, called "experiential transcoding", and present our initial work on identifying patterns in eye-tracking data to guide transcoding of web pages for improving the experience of blind and situationally impaired users.},
