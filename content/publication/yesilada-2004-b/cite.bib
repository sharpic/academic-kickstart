 abstract = {Most Web pages are designed for visual interaction so the mobility, or ease of travel, of visually impaired Web travellers is reduced [2]. Objects that support travel and mobility are not in an appropriate form for nonvisual interaction. Our goal is to enhance the mobility of visually impaired Web travellers by annotating pages with a travel ontology that aims to encap sulate rich structural and navigational knowledge. We propose a semi-automated tool 'Dante' which aims to analyse Web pages to extract travel objects, discover their roles, annotate them with a travel ontology and transform pages based on the annotations to enhance the provided mobility support. This poster introduces the travel ontology and presents how Web pages are annotated with this ontology to guide the transformations.},
