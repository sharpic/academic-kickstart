abstract: "The World Wide Web (Web) has become the means of distribution and use of information by individuals around the world. However, access to this information by visually impaired people is limited due to the Web's visual complexity that implicitly helps sighted users understand and interact with the page content. A variety of usability and accessibility studies show that complicated Web page structure depends on the page composition and layout. During our research we will identify how Web page structural elements, including links, text, and images, interact with each other to produce a visually complex page. In addition we will determine whether pages that sighted users identify as visually complex are complex for visually impaired users as well. ViCRAM is a project that will contribute to the Web Accessibility area by facilitating visually impaired users. We will study sighted users's behaviour and eye movement while interacting with a Web page to elicit their implicit knowledge of visual perception. A relationship will then be distinguished between sighted users' visual cognition and visually impaired users' coping strategies employed when interacting with Web pages. The project's objective is to create a framework that will be used to identify visually complex areas on Web pages for two purposes: to give feedback to visually impaired users regarding the presentation and visual layout of the page; and to help reduce the visual clutter of the page by using the framework as a guide for a Web page transcoding process."
