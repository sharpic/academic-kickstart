 abstract = {This chapter introduces a summary of the physiological processes that support key visual functional capabilities such as visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and field of view. The chapter also considers some of the most common causes of visual dysfunction and their impact on the visual capabilities that are necessary for successful interaction with contemporary computer systems, particularly for access to the World Wide Web. This framework is used to outline the general approaches that have been proposed to facilitate access of individuals with visual impairments to computers, and a few innovative approaches are highlighted as potential directions for further development in this area.},
