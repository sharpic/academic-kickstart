abstract: "© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Battery capacity (energy density) is increasing at around 3% per year. However, the increasing requirements of the mobile platform is placing higher demands on this capacity. In this case, there are three options: decrease our expectations of the mobile platform, increase the capacity and therefore size and weight of our batteries, or create energy saving solutions to extend battery-life with minimal effect on platform performance. Here we present a system called Twes+ which is inline with the last option and aims to transcode web pages for increasing battery-life when surfing-the-web without changing the look and feel. Our evaluation results show that there is a statistically significant energy saving when using our Twes+ transcoder. Our redirect service brings a 4.6% cumulative processor energy reduction, while image transcoding service, brings a 7% cumulative processor energy reduction. These savings equate to between a 40 to 60min saving depending on the mobile device."
