 abstract = {To truly understand how people learn to navigate and use a Web site or application, we need to collect real usage data over extended periods of time. Detailed Web interaction data gathered in the wild (from URLs visited, to keystrokes and mouse movements) has the potential to provide an indepth, ecologically valid view of interaction, and enable an understanding of how behaviour evolves over time. Interpreting such data is extremely challenging, however. We present a longitudinal data-driven analysis of fine-grained interaction data captured from 14,000 recurrent users over 12 months. At the core of our approach is the aggregation of low-level interaction data into micro behaviours. By analysing changes in these behaviours as a function of users' accumulated interaction time, we were able to demonstrate how users' interaction evolves as they become more familiar with a Web page. The results demonstrate that monitoring micro behaviours offers a simple and easily extensible post hoc means of understanding how Web-based behaviour evolves over time.},
