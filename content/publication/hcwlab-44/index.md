abstract: "The visual appearance of a Web page influences the way a user will interact with the page. Part of the ViCRAM project is to determine how Web page structural elements (such as font, tables, links, and images) and their characteristics (such as colour and size) can be used to determine the visual presentation and complexity level of a Web page. This report describes an investigation into how users perceive the visual complexity and aesthetic appearance of Web pages. Results show a strong correlation between users? visual complexity perception of a Web page, structural elements and aesthetic appearance. Data analysis derived models that estimate the visual complexity and aesthetic level of a Web page using the structural elements of the page."
