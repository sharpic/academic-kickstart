 abstract = {The importance of the World Wide Web for information dissemination is indisputable. However, the 
dominance of visual design on the Web leaves visually disabled people at a disadvantage. Although 
assistive technologies, such as screen readers, usually provide basic access to information, the 
richness of the Web experience is still often lost. In particular, traversing the Web becomes a 
complicated task since the richness of visual objects presented to their sighted counterparts are 
neither appropriate nor accessible to visually disabled users. To address this problem, we have 
proposed an approach called Dante in which Web pages are annotated with semantic information to 
make their traversal properties explicit. Dante supports usage of different annotation techniques 
and as a proof-of-concept in this article, pages are annotated manually which when transcoded 
become rich. We first introduce Dante and then present a user evaluation which compares how 
visually disabled users perform certain travel-related tasks on original and transcoded versions 
of Web pages. We discuss the evaluation methodology in detail and present our findings, which 
provide useful insights into the transcoding process. Our evaluation shows that, in tests with 
users, document objects transcoded with Dante have a tendency to be much easier for visually 
disabled users to interact with when traversing Web pages. },
