abstract: "The importance of the World Wide Web for information dissemination is indisputable. However, the  dominance of visual design on the Web leaves visually disabled people at a disadvantage. Although  assistive technologies, such as screen readers, usually provide basic access to information, the  richness of the Web experience is still often lost. In particular, traversing the Web becomes a  complicated task since the richness of visual objects presented to their sighted counterparts are  neither appropriate nor accessible to visually disabled users. To address this problem, we have  proposed an approach called Dante in which Web pages are annotated with semantic information to  make their traversal properties explicit. Dante supports usage of different annotation techniques  and as a proof-of-concept in this article, pages are annotated manually which when transcoded  become rich. We first introduce Dante and then present a user evaluation which compares how  visually disabled users perform certain travel-related tasks on original and transcoded versions  of Web pages. We discuss the evaluation methodology in detail and present our findings, which  provide useful insights into the transcoding process. Our evaluation shows that, in tests with  users, document objects transcoded with Dante have a tendency to be much easier for visually  disabled users to interact with when traversing Web pages. "
