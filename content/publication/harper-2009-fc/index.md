abstract: "Web Accessibility aims to help people with disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, interact, and contribute to the Web. There are millions of people who have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Currently most Web sites have accessibility barriers that make it difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use these sites. This half day tutorial provides a basic training to enable Web engineers to remove these barriers.  The tutorial is split into two parts of equal theoretical and practical training. In the first part you will learn how to build accessibility into your developments from the outset as part of the general development life-cycle; including understanding current research directions. This will involve lessons in: 'Understanding disability and thinking accessibly'; 'Practical engineering'; 'An Orientation around the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines'; 'Eclipse development Frameworks'; and 'Tools and techniques for accessible development'. In the second part you will learn about accessibility validation and repair as part of the debugging cycle along with new accessibility issues. This will involve lessons in: 'Debugging, validation, repair, and EARL', 'aDesigner and other debugging tools', 'Web 2.0, AJAX, Flash, and ARIA', and 'The Mobile Web and other mainstream technology'."
